Second, we would have some scenes that spanned a lot of pages and chapters and then others were a short number of pages and I felt were rushed.

The blurb on the back was interesting and made me open the book quickly. I was in Italy where few books at a library were in English. This was, so I grabbed it. Starting off the story was definitley not thrust into a fast beginning, but it was an easy beginning that you sunk into and were fascinated in.\n",

I felt like there was so much more unraveling than I would have needed, but it was wonderful! These characters actions often surprised me.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the story I was shocked by Dan Brown's obviously extensive research. The perfection of the clues and Path of illumination and way everything mixed togethor was pure genius, I was shocked and kept wondering how such things could work, but having been in Rome I knew it was all so true!\n",

      "I adore the Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown. Ever since I read The Da Vinci Code, I’ve been making my way through the series. Although, I’ve been reading it in the most out-of-order you could ever imagine. And that’s the beauty of this series. It doesn’t matter where you begin. With the last, Origin, in the middle, The Lost Symbol, or with the very first, Angels and Demons.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Dan Brown is a good writer or not. If his books are good or not. One thing is for sure. Wherever Robert travels, the reader travels with him. Brown’s descriptions of places, buildings, and history make the reader travel. And Rome and the Vatican are two places I’m somewhat familiar with because of my architecture degree. I’ve studied some of the places the story refers to. I’ve studied those Renaissance artists so prevalent in the streets and buildings of Rome. And so, I felt I was right there next to Robert, racing against time.\n",
      " Speaking of time, that is probably my biggest criticism of the story. Like all Robert Langdon books, this is a big book. Close to 500 pages. And the story spans 24 hours. It’s a constant race against the clock. Although how much information is being given, it slows the story down. And so, there’s a mix of fast-paced plot breaking at times for context, consequently taking away the trilling memento. The passing of time between chapters also isn’t constant. In some, no time passes at all. And in others, there’s a gap. At times, that made the story feel a bit weird, and it broke off the urgency to keep moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, there isn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about his story. Brown has a gift for mixing fiction with reality in a way you can’t distinguish both. Unless it’s a topic you are very knowledgeable about, there’s no way to separate what are theories and myths from facts. And it’s this mixture that makes the story real and incredibly engaging. It’s about the journey of exploring these secret organisations and creating an engaging narrative that sucks you in. Making you wish everything to be true because it would be a great story. It’s taking conspiracy theories and writing and adventure to uncover them. And what if 90% is fiction? There’s also no map behind the Declaration of Independence, and it’s a lot of fun to follow that story. Even if some details aren’t correct, feeding enough facts makes you believe in everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Dan Brown follows a formula. Going from The Da Vinci Code to Origin, it’s very on the nose. And so, I was curious to see if the same formula was used in Angels and Demons. And in a way, it was. The Robert Langdon books have all the same premise: someone was murdered, there’s a strange symbol, Robert is called, he’s clueless about the crime and sometimes the victim, and the symbol takes him on a journey across a city to uncover something. This is a constant. Although in The Da Vinci Code and Origin, I also saw a formula for the final revelation, the real killer. And luckily, that was a little different. I could predict the one at fault in Origin, and when I read Angels and Demons, I expected to uncover the culprit the same way. But it didn’t work. And I’m glad it didn’t. It would be a bummer after reading only one book of the Robert Langdon series predicting the killer in all the other books after 100 pages. Still, he has a formula that works and continues to use it. And I’m fine with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Angels and Demons was the third book I read in the series, I was already aware of some background information about Robert. Although, since this is the first one published, Robert’s past is fully explained. His claustrophobia is one of his personality traits. That detail appears in every book (that I’ve read so far). Although in later books, it’s never fully explained where it comes from. And it makes sense since it was explained in the very first book of the series. I’ve always liked Robert, and I adore how he always knows everything, and reading Angels and Demons, allowed me to know him at a deeper level. It’s even somewhat explained why there aren’t any romantic relationships in the books despite Robert always having a beautiful woman sidekick.\n",

So picking up the dictionary everytime was never a choice to be made unless you have basic information regarding the structure of Christian churches in Rome.

It also gave me a lot of words, thoughts, and messages to ponder, I've taken note of a lot of words, phrases, and locations from this book to search about and dive into ( though I always remind myself this is just a book of fiction so I should not dive much into this rabbit hole) but I still want to look it up, know some facts about it and theorize and connect the novel to some points, for I know that this book will not be created without some fact checking since all named organization and locations are real and not made up, which led me to this whole thought of, how true everything is? how much is fiction in this book? I know, of course, there is a lot of fiction in this novel but how do they correlate to facts?\n",

      "“You mean the day they stop needing the church,” Vittoria challenged, moving toward him. “Doubt is your last shred of control. It is doubt that brings souls to you. We need to know that life has meaning. Man’s insecurity and need for an enlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan.”\n",

      "It’s been a long time since I last read a Dan Brown book, but I remember vividly being completely in awe of how amazing it was. However, Angels & Demons was… a different experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Robert Langdon movie adaptations have always fascinated me. To say that I’ve watched Angels & Demons at least 20 times is an understatement, being as it is my favourite out of the three releases. Maybe that was my misstake. Maybe Dan Brown books are just meant to be read without any previous knowledge, the surprise factor being key to the whole experience. Maybe my subconscious expectations were too high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storyline of Angels & Demons is incredible, mixing the intricacies and mysteries of Christianity with calculated, dangerous science. The thing about new science and technology however, is that it gets outdated fast. Many of the things mentioned that are ”impossible” are practically child’s play nowadays. Maybe not everybody knows about antimatter, but if you study science in High School you’ve got to at least have heard of it. Additionally, it’s ridiculous that computers can’t make ambigrams! Or, from a writer’s perspective, that there will never be a time in the future where ambigrams will be very easy to procure. I’m sure Dan Brown meant this book to be based in the year 2000, but, personally, it threw me completely off the loop that it was so profoundly based on ”new impossible technology” that didn’t hold up in the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I found quite annoying, even more so than the previous point, was the constant media presence and its main characters. I did not like the story’s angle from their perspective. It was quite boring and, of course after seeing how they did it in the movie, pretty unnecessary the quantity of pages it got. The journalist was a horrid character, not likeable in the least, and the camerawoman, who seemed to be the only one who caught my interest, fell flat halfway through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remaining characters were quite bland as well. Langdon lacked charisma, Olivetti was dislikable but then grew on me and Richter seemed for far too long like a side-side-side character that didn’t really culminate in something truly relevant. Yet Vittoria and Chartrand were great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, nothing beats the awfully written Hassasin. Why was it necessary to make him a sexual predator? Was it truly relevant for the plot? It certainly doesn’t further it, rather it drives from it and loses it’s focus. Also – and maybe it’s just me – but him being Muslim was a weird trait. There was not any true significance to it other than make him brown-skinned and giving him an accent. Why would a Muslim man work for the Illuminati? Wasn’t he religious himself? If not, then why make a big deal of him being Muslim? And if he was, why would he help a satanic group that actively denounces God himself? I’d understand if he was just ”doing a job”, not really caring for who contracted him, but it’s written like he almost worships the brotherhood. It just… did not sit right with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads me to the Camarlengo’s speech when he broke conclave… I have never read such religious propaganda in a literature novel before and my eyes rolled so far back it hurt my skull. Yes, it’s the year 2000, but please make it at least seem believable. There’s absolutely no way that the other Cardinal’s would just go along with a Camarlengo breaking conclave, having a 10 minute speech and on top of that bring media presence, who were reporting everything LIVE, into conclave! The previously reserved, mature Camarlengo completely blew his cover for the reader. It became much too obvious that he was involved, thus the later plot twist had no impact. It felt so forced, with Dan Brown writing over and over again how amazing, brilliant, smart and valiant the Camarlengo was for standing up, all from different perspectives to ensure unanimity.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had been a solid 6 in my mind plummeted to a generous 3 out of 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, one of the few things that holds this book up is Dan Brown’s writing style. I understand it’s not for everybody, but it is for me. The quick pace, the change of perspective… I like it. However, the action scenes were not well planned nor well written. They were messy, hard to follow and sometimes made absolutely no sense. For example, the fact that Vittoria didn’t go with Langdon to help Cardinal Guidera when he was branded but instead chose to wander around the church. Yes, she saw a man literally being burned to death and instead took a stroll around to see what else was going on. Langdon immediately ran to help, yet she didn’t. Besides being lazy writing, it felt completely out of character for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the ending. I… What a way to really nail this book in its grave. It was bad. Too convoluted and took away too much of the significance of the plot throughout. There was no satisfaction to it. After everything that happened, it all boiled down to… a miscommunication? Are you for real?\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s not much left to say. I can’t with good conscience recommend this book, for its adaptation is far superior. All of the incredible aspects are well reflected in the movie and the insufferable ones thankfully omitted. Maybe I shouldn’t have read the book after the movie. Nonetheless, I’m sure I still would’ve found the movie much more enjoyable either way.\n",

I found the writing dull, the characters two-dimensional, and the entire book utterly lacking in inciting any emotional response, aside from the occasional bout of surprise.

But this is the best Dan Brown novel, hands down, by far. It's complex, exquisite, and has a pretty awesome message that science and religion CAN exist together in harmony.\n",

But Brown does have a way of showcasing these gorgeous European cities in an fast-paced, epic adventure that interweaves history, science, and religion.

I like the scientific side of the story.. the antimatter, for me that is an interesting topic and I just wish that that is true! Science is beneficial to mankind, we just have to use it properly. Religion for me is an important thing to mankind, though, you can live without it for I believe that religion is not that matter, it is the faith. I guess, I am not affected by the topic Religion, since this book tackles a lot about Catholicism, and although I am a Catholic, I know that religion is not perfect, it is made by human.. and humans are never perfect. I know that religion is flawed because man is flawed. I also know that religion is just a mere representation of our faith.. Also, the story taught me a lot about the process of having a new Pope also about the rules and so on. Well, I'm too young to know that.

I haven’t read a thriller like this in my life (even though I haven’t read so many thrillers.) The plot is something like this :- World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization -- the Illuminati. In a desperate race to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and courageous scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, and deserted cathedrals, and into the depths of the most secretive vault on earth...the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.\n",
      "After reading this book you will know almost every places in Vatican city. There is mixed reviews about Dan Brown’s books, but man... I LOVE HIS BOOKS! It’s:- fast paced, have codes, Some sort of investigation (I am a die hard admirer of Sherlock Holmes), numerous twist and turns, history, good vs evil story, what does a reader like me need more than these? It have been a long time since I read a book that I can’t put down. Many of the twists are unexpected, especially the last one, no one will see it coming. Also it give answers too some of my spiritual questions/doubts. I disagree with some of the philosophies in the book, but I will never ever regret reading this book.

      "Angels and Demons is the first book in a series that features chronic bachelor, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious iconology. Doesn't sound that interesting right? Wrong. Langdon is actually a very handy man to have around when the Illuminati resurfaces and murders a physicist by branding a strange symbol on his chest. A physicist who happens to be a priest of the Catholic church and who also believes he has found scientific proof of God's hand in the creation of the universe. Scandalous. Turns out a professor of religious iconology is bloody fascinating, who would have thought? Not me before reading this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love a intelligent, bookish man in tweed and I just really liked Robert Langdon as a character, Mickey Mouse watch and all. Vittoria Vetra on the other hand, is another matter. She is the murdered physicist's adopted daughter and a scientist in her own right. She started off as smart and independent but as the book went on she just became like a prop to the story in order to add an element of eye candy and sexual tension. Sadly, by the end of the book, Vittoria was just a cardboard cut out woman that was inserted into the story for Robert to be distracted by. That was kinda rubbish to be honest and I wished her character had more of a role.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not going to deny this book is a page turner, the chapters are short, the tension is high - the piecing together of the puzzle was interesting but I just felt like there wasn't much substance under all of that. Which is odd considering there is a humongous load of historical detail on Vatican City, renaissance artists, symbols, papal politics, etc.  I just wanted a little more of a deeper look into it all. For instance, the identity of the assassin and how he was recruited is never really revealed and was glossed over in favour of the big twist at the end.\n",
      "\n",

I've heard that Dan Brown uses the same formula in every book, but in my opinion, as long as the ride is enjoyable, who cares how predictable the plot is? I remember reading and liking the Da Vinci Code back in the day and decided to check out the prequel. The book started off kind of slow, which is to be expected as the main character is introduced and yada, yada yada. But what really drew me into the book was the immense inclusion and integration of tons of topics I'm interested in: Science, history, art, symbology, conspiracy theories, theology (to an extent) and so on. And, somehow the book actually manages to make these topics interesting, along with a semi-believable plot and logical decisions being made (barring a few at the end). Was the book kind of ridiculous and preachy at times? Sure, but considering these moments were pretty sparse, I decided to just shrug them off. Overall, I enjoyed this book a lot, and am strongly tempted to read more in the series.\n",

That being said, I liked the novel for what it was: a fluffy, semi-suspenseful, \"best-seller list\" type of read. Brown doesn't write well, which I knew going into the book. His adjectives and descriptions aren't imaginative by any means, but his way of weaving historical fact into his fiction is. I looked up a lot of the people, places, etc. on the internet as I was reading the book and found that nearly everything he references has a basis in fact (and the places are real of course). Part of the reason that I liked the books is because I've been to Italy so I know the places he refers to in a personal way.\n",

The Illuminati carries out a high profile symbolic execution of the preferiti, the four cardinals most expected to win the papal election, and plans to use a small sample of Vetra's anti-matter to reduce Vatican City to a pile of rubble as a final close to the interminable battle between cutting edge science and Roman Catholic dogma.\n",

Angels and Demons is plot, plot and yet more plot! But my money says it succeeds wildly and is a novel that is not only spectacularly entertaining but should avoid the visceral polarization of its readership that The Da Vinci Code managed to produce. I might go even further. Despite reading from the point of view of a non-practicing and disenchanted Roman Catholic, educated and believing profoundly in the value of scientific research and technology, I would nevertheless suggest that Angels and Demons presents a credible, balanced FICTIONAL story of a climactic confrontation between these two long-time arch-enemies. Ah, heck ... if anything, the scientists come out on the cruddy end of the stick and look more the bad guy than the church! That's OK - that provides a rather nice foil to the outlook one gets from a reading of The Da Vinci Code!\n",

I watched the movie years ago when it came out, but had forgotten much of the plot, so I wasn’t spoiled for the end though, leading up to it, I did suspect who the mastermind behind the heinous acts was. I also wasn’t put off by the switches in perspective, which I didn’t expect. We even get to read from one of the antagonist’s perspectives, which didn’t do much for me since that antagonist, the Hassassin, didn’t have much depth.\n",

      "Actually, almost all the characters lacked depth, but I didn’t care. I was too hooked on the plot. Besides, the focus of the story is the plot, not the characters. If it was the other way around, I would have been sorely disappointed. The plot progressed at a slow pace as Brown allows his protagonist, Robert Langdon, to adjust to the situation he’s flown into. The slow pace also gives Brown time to fill in the reader on prior events and show off Langdon’s extensive knowledge of history, religion, art, and symbology and how great he looks in his tweed jacket, which sometimes annoyed me. It’s obvious that Brown really likes this character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major character is Vittoria Vetra, the daughter of the murder victim. Vittoria was gutsier than I thought she would be, but also a little disappointing too, but that’s probably because I think she was only included so that Langdon could rescue her at the end like a knight rescuing a princess trapped in a tower. Lol, smh. I guess those fantastical elements are part of the reason why I enjoyed the story though they did annoy me.\n",

Because of the nature of the bomb, I thought it would be impossible to get rid of or dismantle it. And Langdon surviving all that didn’t seem believable either. Though I liked that Langdon felt a surge of courage that led him to rescue Vittoria (and that she saves herself), I couldn’t ignore the racial dynamics of the situation and couldn’t stop thinking of it as a White dude (knight in shining armor) who must prevent the White woman (damsel in distress) from being defiled by a person of color (monster who should be destroyed). I keep going back and forth on this because that Hassassin dude was horrible and I was rooting for Langdon but was happy when Vittoria sorta saved herself and Langdon too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, other stuff I liked about this story is the little bits of things I learned, like Hassassin, which were actually real and were a feared sect of Islamic warriors and the word “assassin” is derived from it. I also didn’t know about the Swiss Guard until I read this book. I’ve heard the term used, but didn’t know what they did or that Michelangelo designed their outlandish uniform (well, so people say). I quite like their uniform, though it must make clandestine operations in the field quite difficult (assuming they wear their uniform all the time, which they probably don’t).\n",

      "Of course, I also enjoyed this story because of the discussion it provides on religion and science and how the two relate to each other.

It was fast paced, well thought out, and always had you thinking to solve the mysteries and riddles at every turn. Still, I was shocked by the twists and turns of the plot! At times, I could literally feel my heart rate speeding up; it was as if I couldn’t read the words quickly enough. Even more, I appreciate that despite bringing the reader immediately into the action, the author was able to develop the characters to be complex and interesting.

The writing is fast paced and easy to tear through, but not exceptionally good. But despite these books being incredibly formulaic and silly at times, they’re just so fun. Of the three I’ve read, this is my least favorite. While I enjoyed the conversations about religion vs science, I didn’t find the clue solving to be as engrossing and I guessed the plot twist early.

It's very well written for most of the book, but certain passages would suddenly seem like they were written for a younger audience, or that Brown didn't expect us to be able to follow what was going on. These passages happened most often during flashbacks or when he was trying to explain something. Every once in a while the dialogue became a little YA too.

But the reader doesn't really get too involved in figuring that out, because unless you're an Illuminati enthusiast and Italian history buff, you only get the information Brown gives you , as he gives it to you. There's really no way to figure it out before Langon does. That doesn't lessen the story by any means, but I don't consider it a mystery, just a work of fiction.

A filmet már láttam korábban, és igazából csak az maradt meg bennem, hogy Ewan McGregor gonosz volt. :D Így semmit sem sejtettem a történetről! Az eleje elég lassan indult be, meg picit meglepődtem ezen a szuper repülőgépen, mert olyan hihetetlennek tűnt, de megbékéltem vele. Eltelt nagy nehezen 100-200 oldal, és végre kezdett érdekes lenni a dolog! Ahogy Langdon és Vittoria a Vatikánba lépett izgalmassá vált a helyzet, és csak úgy pörögtek a lapok. Élveztem, ahogy megtalálják az illuminátus ösvényeket, ez a rész tökéletes volt. Onnantól kezdve, hogy Langdon elkezdett dulakodni a hasszaszinnal onnantól kezdett kicsit hihetetlennek tűnni a történet! Érdekesnek tartottam, hogy Langdont kb 3szor szerették volna (ha nem többször) megölni, meg egy csomó megpróbáltatáson ment keresztül, de egyszer se esett semmi baja. Vittoria nem volt szimpatikus számomra, persze tudom, hogy apja halála miatt mégis milyen legyen az ember, de nem tetszett a természete. Langdont néha kicsit butusnak találtam, főleg a végén, mikor nem jött rá mit szimbólizál a Camerlengora égetett jel…könyörgöm, anyanyelve az angol, nem hiszem el, hogy nem látja meg benne az Eart, Air, Fire, Water szavakat…ettől meg tudtam volna őrülni! (Persze ez egy könyv, de szinte úgy éreztem, mintha igaz lenne, lehet ezért háborodok fel ennyire :D) Az egész könyv alatt gyanakodtam az emberekre, hogy ki lehet az a híres Janus….gondoltam Vittoriára, (egyszer Langdonra is :D), Kohenre, Camerlengora is. Rocher kapitányról egyből tudtam, hogy köze lesz valamihez…. Sajnos, ma így a vége előtt, tudomásomra jutott, hogy Camerlengot Ewan McGregor játszotta a filmben, így tiszta sor volt, hogy ő lesz Janus! Összességében okés könyv volt, voltak benne részek amik mondom a tetszésemet elnyerték, viszont a végét jobban meg lehetett volna írni, mivel kicsit összekapottnak éreztem! De bravó, hogy Dan Brown ilyet meg tudott írni! :)\n",

      "So, I have a lot of mixed feelings about the book that I'm not really sure how to write out. I knew before reading this that Dan Brown and The Davinci Code was pretty controversial. It dealt with some pretty heavy subjects, like religion. I, myself, am not religious so I consider myself pretty ignorant in matters like this. Because of that, I kind of avoided the book and Dan Brown for the longest time because I wasn't sure if I would really get it. But, after a while, I decided to just go ahead and read it. Maybe a lot of things would fly over my head or wouldn't affect me, but it would be an interesting read to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "My final thoughts on it were eventually this: It's an entertaining read at the least, but you have to sort of \"turn off your brain\" if you want to enjoy it. I'm sorry if that doesn't make much sense, I'll try to explain it down below.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew that Dan Brown tended to be very \"liberal\" about interpretations on historical events religious matters, so I read with that in mind. There are different things that Dan Brown changes around about history and other similar subjects. Some of these are pretty hard to suspend disbelief for...so it's something that's very hard to work around (I personally just pretended this all was happening in some parallel universe, haha). I don't know if this means that this novel is very poorly written or if Brown just took a lot of artistic licenses, but that's a hurdle I had to overcome in reading this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that Brown does in his writing is that he jumps around a lot from different characters and events. I know that this is supposed to be showing the entire story through different perspectives, but I sometimes feel that it really contributed nothing or was just a waste of space. It also felt jarring at times. Sometimes it would feel there was no focus, and other times it felt like it was cutting off a good action sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there were some things that just seemed...implausible to me. I mean, this entire books kind of relies on you having to suspend your disbelief and having to accept some unorthodox interpretations and whatnot, but it got too unbelievable to me at some times. Like, there are countless researchers and scientists studying these topics, and Robert Langdon was the only guy who could figure these puzzles out? There are quite a few other examples, but they're spoilery so I won't get into them. I'll just say this: some scenes were making me scratch my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if this was just me or not, but did anyone else feel like Vetra could have been completely taken out and the novel wouldn't have really lost anything of substance? I feel like she just fulfills the \"Sexy Foreign Love Interest Trope\". I don't know, it might just be me. The romance itself was poorly written, and I cared very little for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a whole theme about science vs. religion, which I know is a pretty powerful debate, but the theme didn't really resonate with me, so I can't comment on it. I'm sure people that are more knowledgeable with the subject can comment on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest issues I had with the book was Brown's writing itself. I can usually overlook bad prose if the story / characters are good, but this wasn't the case here. The writing was pretty choppy to me and not paced really well. There are some weird descriptions here and there and it sometimes felt like a juvenile trying to write more advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, with everything said and done? I still found it entertaining. It wasn't a boring book at all. I got some enjoyment out of reading it, if just for the fact that it was a mediocre thriller that was able to hold my attention until the end. I've read a lot of books that are so bad or so boring that I wasn't able to finish it. Angels & Demons didn't fall in either of those categories. It's just a fun book with some action that's decent to read. Yes, you have to overcome many hurdles to get some pleasure out of reading this book, but it wasn't absolutely terrible. This might be because I don't know a whole lot about the controversy surrounding Dan Brown and the Da Vinci Code. But if you can suspend your disbelief far enough (and I mean REALLY far) and have a tolerance for mediocre writing...it's not terrible.\n",

      "First, I must say that although the author tends to be long-winded, I did enjoy the writing style of it. I liked the details and descriptions of things the characters were seeing: the churches, the cathedrals, the sculptures, etc. After reading the book I searched for pictures of some of the sculptures and I must say that the real thing matched pretty closely with the image I had in my mind's eye. So bravo to Mr. Brown for his word-smithing. Additionally, although the writing *appears* to be complex and intelligent, it is actually very accessible and the 600-ish pages really seemed to fly by. I finished this book in just a few hours. It is very easy to read. Furthermore, hats off to John Langdon for the clever ambigrams!\n",

      "However, parts of the story just seemed... outright silly. Impossibly silly. Sometimes silly is good, like when you write a children's story about entering a fantastic world called Narnia through a closet.

For example, would YOU follow a dangerous assassin into a dark place, by yourself, armed only with a little pistol? Would YOU jump out of a helicopter that is 4,000 feet in the air with just a little sheet to break your fall? Would YOU confront a dangerous man alone and tell him to \"confess your sins?\" Every time one of these things happened (and these are just a few examples), I rolled my eyes. It didn't feel suspenseful, it just felt stupid. And -- I don't want to give anything away -- the plot twist at the end of the story... Let's just say it left much to be desired.\n",

      "And finally -- here comes the controversial part -- the portrayal of the church left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Here we have a book with many, many complaints about how the Church has stifled science for centuries. Many portrayals of corrupt individuals inside the church. Yes, I understand that history can't be denied, and these things happened, but out of all the characters in the book, there were perhaps two that actually came across as real Christians. And there are people who say, \"In this book, the Church comes out looking pretty good, what are you upset about?\" The only reason the Church comes out looking pretty good is because of an elaborate deception. The string of events in this book is shameful, really, from a Christian point of view. The person behind the killings is a jaded Catholic priest -- forgiveness comes with the territory! And then the deception, that was the most insulting of all: Please, don't tell anyone who murdered these people because it will make people lose faith in God? Really? Are Christians so empty-headed that they need an elaborate lie to maintain their faith? What's next, Mr. Brown? Are you going to write a novel about how Robert Langdon walks on water to give Christians faith in God? Hmm?\n",

Vittoria was a shallow character that seemed to be there in an attempt to have a \"strong\" female character. But she neither added much, nor was very strong on her own.

The material concerning historical facts and the layout, architecture, and art of Rome is well researched. There were several incorrect references to other religious material, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism (Brown should probably brush up on his Indian religion before including them with Western ideologies on account of the fundamental differences regarding the idea of God and the meaning of life). Overall, however, a very enjoyable read. I moved quickly through the material in all the suspense Brown plotted and I thought the ending was very tastefully done, with resonance of the wit and sarcasm of Robert and Vittoria's interactions through the story.

Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology professor, is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. The story takes up from there as Langdon joins forces with the enigmatic scientist Vittoria Vetra and discover unimaginable secrets.\n",
      "The book was absolutely compelling to read for me. Every time the action picked up, I could feel my heart race, and my eyes, brains, mind... whatever, could not get enough of each line. The whole plot is very engrossing and gives an adrenaline rush throughout. Some may find Dan Brown's writing \"very unrealistic\" or \"unbelievable\" but I say it's all about the imagination. It should be. I suppose for readers who have a very active and wild imagination (like me) it's admittedly easier to find this novel (and his other books) enthralling. For me, his writing is dramatic. I mean dramatic in a good \"historical mystery-scientific facts\" kind of way (if such a thing even exists) and not the \"tragedy-romance-family\" kind of way.\n",
      "Normally, books with short chapters irritate me because I am a person who craves more descriptive plots. However, Brown's books have to be the only exception for me where my mind crawls back for more. The fast-paced thriller makes it very enjoyable– you can feel the fulfillment through the small yet stimulating chapters. Similar to The Da Vinci Code (another bestseller of Dan Brown), the author bounces from one point of view to another without leaving the reader confused. Since I've been switching between classic - romances, and mystery - thrillers (because, why not?) lately, it's refreshing to read a thriller book with the story shown from different angles after reading a classic with one point of view. It brings me a sense of contentment as I watch the story unfold from all those angles.\n",
      "If you're a \"no-nonsense\" person who's into serious and current affairs storylines, I'd advise against reading this book (along with Brown's other books) as there is a slight possibility that you may find it absurd halfway. Regardless, all I can say is that this book is an incredible piece of work and it's guaranteed you'll find it so if you're a fan of The Da Vinci Code. If you're searching for something to read that satisfies your imaginative brain, you should definitely check this book out. It's fun to imagine the whole plot in your head while reading it–only if you haven't watched the movie yet. Else you'd probably imagine the actors and actions from the movie.\n",

Si consideramos que este libro tiene 900 paginas aprox e Inferno tiene 500 aprox, este libro empieza cuando Inferno está terminando.

If you're looking for a pop-culture reference to how to pass Orientalism this would be an ok book to look at. Though the book focused on the fall of the church, it ingeniously brought the church as the main focus and continuously asserted it as the most important religion on earth. Vittoria was a hollow character to me as well. I felt she was included just so she could be the one female character in a book full of white men.

Brown shows us both the best and the worst in each of his characters, then throws them together in the most intense 24 hours of their lives to discover their breaking points.

If you use a real religion, as well as real places in your writing, in my humble opinion you should research them a little better. The story also seemed rushed, most of the action happening in the course of 4-5 hours. There was just something off about the way that he wrote his action scenes, and I just can't quite put my finger on it other than say they felt too rushed.

This latter spirituality, while found in many churches, does not represent Catholicism, nor biblical Christianity. If your own religious convictions are deeper than what is presented in popular press and media, the religious reductionism in this story is a little frustrating.

I wanted to learn more, to know the secrets of the Illuminati and the only way to do it was to let the story naturally unfold as I read.

      "I never read one of the Dan Brown books but decided to pick this one up to fill two of my challenges. One of the challenges was for a book bingo square *pick up a book everybody but you read* and the other challenge was for the big books. As I am a rigid series reader always wanting to start at the beginning I went with Angels and Demons and not The Da Vinci Code. Before picking up this book I was curious. I love mystery books where symbols laying out trails are used but I was not really attracted to the Illuminati and religious aspect of the book (the reason I had not picked it up before). While reading the book I did notice that it was indeed not gripping me as much as other books written in this concept. This does mean I have to applaud the writing style of Dan Brown because he did manage to pull me in and making me want to read the book.\n",
      "The story starts out on an early morning in Roberts house where you get onto the roller coaster with him which brings him to Europe and pulls him into this mystery. Robert is described as a man who loves his job, teaching and puzzling with religious symbols. I had the feeling he is a friendly and calm man. This does come out later in the story if we see him trough the eyes of Vittoria. He was easy to connect with him and feel for him when he gets in difficult situations. The fiery Vittoria is a very strong female character, I did experience her as a bit cold and calculated in some situations which was usually explained with her experience in one or another research project. The interaction between the characters was great and I did like that despite the fact that they are both smart people they did not all of a sudden got smarter in the field of the other character.\n",
      "The development in the story has you on the edge of your seat from the start. You go from one situation to the other and it is one big whirlwind pulling you in deeper and deeper. As said before I could not always muster up interest in the subject of the story which sometimes stalled me in reading but something would happen that made me want to continue reading. There is a lot of speed in the story but there is no haste. Every situation has a clear beginning, explanation, action and end. After this experience The Da Vinci Code is still not on the top of my next to read list but I would surely do not mind picking it up.\n",

      "En primer lugar quiero hacerme una pregunta a mi misma basada en el hecho de que estuve durante mucho tiempo con el libro ahí sin poder terminarlo, sin embargo, no es que no me gustase, me gustaba tanto pero la vida no quería que yo lo leyera y me mandaba a hacer cosas extras para que yo no retomara la lectura. ¿Afectó a mi perspectiva general el leer de manera intermitente el libro? Yo creo que sí, porque el libro está construido para dejarte con dudas a cada capítulos que leías. Lo extraño de esto es que yo me iba satisfecha y con las intrigas por saber si los personajes salvarían a los cardenales, pero no era una cuestión que me carcomiera la cabeza. Supongo que era porque no me importaba si morían o no, yo estaba más al pendiente de el conflicto principal que era esta bomba de antimateria. No digo que no fue emocionante porque sí lo era, solo que se resolvía en un par de capítulos y luego volvía a repetirse el mismo descenlace. Esa conclusión de esos micro conflictos me gustó porque al principio creía que podrían salvar por lo menos a uno de los cardenales, no obstante, el autor prefirió completar la misión de los \"Illuminatis\" y me pareció un acierto, aunque lo que no me terminó de encajar fue el rol de los medios en esta carrera contra el tiempo. Se me quedó corto y no le sentí el peso que debía tener pensando en que debió existir un contrastre entre la espectacularización de los hechos y la crítica sobre los límites morales, también un poco hacia la pregunta de qué pueden lograr los medios más allá del pánico o del morbo. Ciertamente podrían haber movilizado a la gente, aunque no sin sembrar pánico y ahí estaría lo complejo, el ver la manera correcta de entregar un mensaje, para qué y hacia quién.\n",

      "Segundo, pese a que el libro podría haberse transformado en un tocho denso lleno de información que no entendería a menos que hiciera una carrera de arte y religión, no lo hizo. Efectivamente tenía mucha información pero nunca se sintió densa, porque no era necesario memorizarla para que quedase claro. El vínculo entre la información y la búsqueda del personaje quedaba clara porque se evidenciaba de inmediato de una forma concisa. Eso me hizo disfrutable la lectura porque me generó intriga pero sin instalarme demasiadas dudas que no podría responder a menos que consultara en google. Aunque, no estoy del todo segura que tanto puedo confiar en la información entregada por el protagonista, puede que haya muchas cosas que hayan tenido que ser adaptadas para cumplir con ciertos propósitos, pero siento que en este caso no se trata de la veracidad de cada pieza de información en la vida real, se trata más de cómo encajan las piezas para llegar a una gran conclusión echa de un todo.\n",

I liked the mystery, the characters were for the most part intriguing, I do understand people’s complaints that the book is very exposition heavy, but I for one did not mind this because my understanding of the Illuminati and ancient Catholic Church is very limited. I have 2 issues with this book. Framing Koehler as “Janus” or the head of the Illuminati because he is angry at god for putting him in a wheelchair, in a way feels ableist. The text reads something along the lines of this will be koehlers revenge for never being touched by a woman is just cringe and really reduces his character to his disability. I thought that was a little lazy. Also the ending was incredible dumb, like Langdon just fell out of a helicopter and Vittoria’s father was murdered but yes let’s get them to bang in a hotel because they have some chemistry? Just felt a bit unnecessary. Other than that I found the book to be a fun read, and despite its length and problems here and there I did enjoy it and will be continuing on with the series!\n",

You also get to a lot about the Vatican City, its secret archives, its beautiful monuments - when it was built, who built it, what significance does it have, etc. It's a fast-paced book and we also get to know a lot about the clergy system of the Catholic Church in the Vatican City and in general.\n",

As a reader, I would just request you to neglect some inaccuracies and, accepting the fact that it is fiction, just enjoy the book.\n",

      "The Catholic Church’s circus tent is about to come crashing down. Dan Brown is incredible at creating a fast-paced while still multi-layered thriller that at the same has the spectacle and religious esotericism as an Indiana Jones film. (Robert Langdon is effectively Indiana Jones without the aesthetic) The religious and artistic history entranced me like hypnosis—Christians stole the practice of “god-eating” from the Aztecs after conquering their empire. Some of the plot points seemed a little unnecessary though—why does Robert go into the helicopter? I did the love the fast pace but slow burn of the reveals, like the dead Pope actually being the camerlengo’s father and not just his foster father, and the camerlengo’s reveal as Janus. Vittoria and Robert are a cute couple, and they are definitely a good match—she’s determined and flexible (literally and figuratively) and he’s quiet and compassionate. The scientific theory, though advanced, is clearly and concisely explained to the non-scientific mind. The backstories (for Langdon and Vittoria especially) are incredibly compelling, like how Vittoria came to meet and grow up with the man that would adopt her. The Hassassin’s deadly inspiration and glorious delight in his cruelty weave a spell-binding villain. But the one of the most significant elements of the story is the fact that you can truly walk this Path of Illumination—from “Habakkuk and the Angel” in the Chigi Chapel in the cathedral of Santa Maria del Popolo (Earth—Terra) to the “West Ponente” relief in St. Peter’s Square (Air—Aria) to “The Ecstasy of St. Teresa” in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria (Fire—Fuòco) to the Fountain of the Four Rivers in front of the church of Saint Agnes in Agony in the Piazza Navona (Water—Acqua) and finally to the Church of Illumination within Castel Sant’Angelo. The path is real though the story may not be. Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest…\n",

      "Me encanta saber de historia, arte, arquitectura y un sinfín de obras y de autores que, a menos de que hayas tenido un profesor apasionado, difícilmente conocerías. La historia humana tiene miles de vértices e interpretaciones y tardaría siglos en discernir la verdad de un invento.\n",

      "No sé qué tan cierto sea cada dato escrito, o qué tan verídica sea la historia planteada, sobretodo con los Iluminati, pero de una cosa estoy segura y es que me gusta ese tipo de polémica entre la ciencia y la religión. Y que no se malinterprete. El conflicto entre ambas ha hecho que corra sangre, pero ambos lados son tan parecidos que me atrevo a llamarlos las dos caras de una misma moneda. Desde cualquier extremo, se busca una verdad que alimente el espíritu de las personas, o bien, que sacie su curiosidad y pueda, de alguna forma, responder a las preguntas que desde el inicio de la humanidad han surgido. ¿De dónde venimos? ¿Qué hay además de nosotros? ¿Cómo se creó la vida? ¿Hay algo después de la muerte? Y la lista sigue.\n",
      "Considero que muchas personas sensibles se toman a mal las dudas que a uno le surgen, sobre todo si no hay información que avale sus creencias, y fuera de intentar buscar una razón, sólo siguen con los ojos cerrados, creyendo en algo que, sinceramente, yo no le tengo fe sólo porque sí. Mi lado pragmático y lógico me exige una prueba tangible de las cosas y por ende, me resulta sumamente difícil compaginar con gente que hace lo que le dicen sin cuestionar nada.\n",
      "Por otro lado, gente de la comunidad científica o no vayamos tan lejos, una persona que pueda pensar por sí misma, toma como insulto cualquier cosa que pueda demeritar a la importancia que tienen las religiones en la actualidad. Y se olvidan de que hay cosas más allá de nosotros mismos, situaciones que aún no tienen una respuesta concreta y que quizá sólo \"se sienten\".\n",

What was even more telling is that this character was a supposed employee of the illuminati which was against all organised religion, yet this character was angry at Christians for the Crusades against Muslims? All in all this character could have been so much better. The twist at the end of the novel when the whole plot comes together also just adds more confusion onto him.

Brown’s writing I found was easily readable and I also really enjoyed the short chapters. When reading a book with shorter chapters, I feel I am making faster progress in the book and I am more inclined to continue reading if I can get through six or more chapters in 45 minutes.

Robert Langdon is a great protagonist, reading his arc from Harvard professor to “hero” was fantastic! I also thoroughly enjoyed the many plot twists throughout the novel. At times I was questioning things as if I knew something might happen and other times I was completely surprised when a plot twist would occur. This book has the things I look for in what I consider a “good book,” it had action, adventure, romance, suspense, humor and it taught me something.

The Illuminati has historically been known to contain many famous members as well as a hatred for the Catholic Church.

This book's heroine is Vittoria, a lady mourning her father, but not without gumption and brains of her own. The plot is intricate and educational at the same time. This book centers around the Illuminati and their plot to destroy the Vatican once and for all. The author manages to create vibrant and realistic characters against the backdrop of historically and spiritually significant locales.

After hundreds of years, they're now back for revenge. The Pope has just died and the cardinals are gathered in the Vatican to elect the next one.

It's up to symbologist Langdon and his CERN researcher Vittoria to stop the murders and defuse the bomb in time.\n",

      "I wanted to have fun on this roller coaster, but it kept breaking down. There was only one thing keeping this from being a really great book: the author. The story grabs you early on with a ticking bomb somewhere in the Vatican and a gruesome death and then proceeds to send you on what should have been a non-stop ride to save four kidnapped Cardinals, save the Vatican from the bomb, and rescue the girl. Unfortunately, there were stops along the way, and the further along you got, the more stops there were.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, the biggest problem with the story was the author. Too many times he had characters repeating what they or another character had said as recently as five sentences before. There were far too many contradictions, such as one character saying he was a Catholic priest, so he didn't need to be told about the Illuminati, then three sentences later saying he wasn't familiar with something about them. There were statements that were patently untrue, such as a centuries-old \"demon hole\" that was still so full of vapors from rotting corpses that it made it dificult to breathe. There were complete failures of imagination on the author's part, such as an escape from a locked room that was ripped straight out of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" And, worst of all, there were far too many instances, especially in the last 20% of the book, of downright improbabilities. How does Langdon know what's been going on in the Vatican when he's been trapped under a stone coffin, chasing and fighting the assassin, and rescuing the girl for the past hour-and-a-half? It takes nine minutes to run from St. Peter's square, down a bunch of stairs into the bowels of the earth, and then up a hill to St. Peter's tomb, unencumbered and relatively fresh, but it takes less than seven minutes to retrace that route while carrying a bulky canister and exhausted from the trip down? The door of the Sistine Chapel is open when Langdon enters to show the Caridnals a video, but has to be unlocked when the camerlengo enters just a few minutes later? How can you enjoy the ride when the author keeps pulling you out of the car like this?\n",

      "I'm not sure there is anything to be said about Dan Brown's Robert Langdon novels that hasn't already been said by now, so I won't. I will just say that as a thriller, the book is decent, although the romantic subplot is utterly unconvincing and pro forma. As a text on history, religious symbolism, and the relationship between faith and science, the book is, as the kids say, redonkulous. The word \"redonkulous\" may have in fact been invented to describe Dan Brown thrillers. This book made me laugh out loud in several places, and not in the places I was meant to laugh.

Obviously there should be, but I wouldn't recommend using Brown's books as a guide to writing women.

I thought I had it all figured out about halfway through the book and was ready to call this book predictable, but the continual twists at the end definitely threw me.\n",

Honestly, I couldn’t see either of them in a relationship with each other. Their personalities are just not compatible.

There are so many more creative and less disturbing ways to torture someone, but because it’s a woman, it’s always rape.\n",

Descriptions of characters and buildings are overly long and ridiculous. The tone is silly, at best. The first section can be summed up in \"Science is Magic. Religion is Sacred. Murder is Special. Scientists lack Basic Logic Skills. Science puts a finger in the Christian God's eye.\" Why did they call up the protagonist for the problem? Because, that's why. Brown likes to use vaguery to keep antagonists in the dark, referring to them as generic titles and overdoing their reactions to things to make them \"spooky\", turning them more into villains from stories you tell your children to get them to brush their teeth. Just makes the whole thing more ridiculous.\n",

If you want a story chockful of biblical iconography and such mixed in with science, read \"Dune\". Not this. Also, try to avoid any \"modern\" audiobooks narrated by Richard Poe.

      "Why I Recommend Bumping This DOWN On Your TBR: I can understand how some readers enjoy the little factual tidbits, but I would have preferred reading those in a nonfiction book, rather than having them scattered throughout this boring plot. I also don't appreciate how Vittoria is written. We start off with her making a demand and being told she is not allowed to see the body of her recently deceased father, until she goes through some BS, and only then is she \"allowed\" to see her father. Then we have a chapter in which we go back in time and she is \"saved\" by her father who adopts her. There are some attempts by the author to balance the good with the bad, as she is written as a skilled and intelligent woman. But she is framed mostly as the love interest of our comfortably-bachelor protagonist, and the attention called to her body, while not the worst I've ever read, is definitely intended for cishetmale readers.\n",

      "Anjos e Demónios, confesso, não correspondeu às minhas expetativas. Todo aquele entusiasmo e ânsia de ler mais que senti durante a leitura d' O Código Da Vinci ultrapassou em muito a excitação que este livro me suscitou, talvez porque a arquitetura narrativa de Anjos e Demónios segue os mesmos moldes e, por isso, não me surpreendeu, para além de abordar um tema que não considero tão aliciante. Ainda assim, apesar da familiaridade com a estrutura, a habitual procura do responsável e a urgência de saber como tudo irá acabar cativam o leitor e fazem-no voar pelas páginas. Os livros de Dan Brown constituem sempre uma ótima oportunidade de aprendizagem, embora devamos ter o cuidado de realizar uma pesquisa posterior, para diferenciar os factos da ficção. As personagens são muito bem construídas, de personalidade vincada, e as surpresas sucedem-se até ao fim. Assim, pela rede de personagens envolvidas na intriga e pelas reviravoltas constantes, é difícil sintetizar o enredo do romance. A minha maior crítica dirige-se à rapidez irrealista com que se sucedem os acontecimentos. Como a ação se desenrola em apenas 24 horas, é necessário que tudo aconteça depressa, para que Langdon e Vittoria acompanhem o ritmo dos assassinatos. Isso leva a que algumas conversas, reflexões e deslocações tenham uma duração impossivelmente curta, de acordo com a narração. Apesar disso, gostei do livro, principalmente da última centena de páginas, quando os mistérios são desvendados. Anjos e Demónios conjuga aventura, suspense, drama e romance, num ritmo que nos embala ao longo das frases simples, mas impactantes.\n",

This book is a perfect combination of history, science, religion, mystery, action and suspense. I was reading this on the edge of my seat from the moment Langdon arrived in Rome until the last page. I don't read a lot of mystery or thrillers so it's not really a suprise, but I really didn't see this ending coming. So many twist and turns! Another great part of this story was the setting. The description of Rome, the churches and the art was done so well. It almost felt like I was there, racing against the clock, with Langdon and Vittoria. I also really liked the characters. Even though there were so many 'just on time' moments which normally is so unrealistic that wasn't the case in this book. The background of the two main characters made their actions believable and I loved having an intelligent, snarky, get shit done character for once. There was enough doubt and fear to make it realistic without getting annoying and taking too long. Seriously, such a good book. Not like anything I've read before.

The Illuminati is just sort of a joke for me, and it was just very odd seeing these people's reactions to it in the book. They had either never heard of it somehow, or they only knew if it from a popular video game. On a similar note, it was also odd to me that no one had heard of anti-matter either.

Anyway, aside from legends and mythology, I love reading about history (be it native, heroic or religious). And I can say that a major factor of me going through all 710 pages of this book was the history of the church and discovering art through reading and not by seeing the artwork itself. The climax to the falling action of the book was a mix of emotions and I couldn’t put it down even after a tiring day at the firm. Took me a while to read the book.

Unfortunately, in one part of the book, given twenty minutes, the protagonists can, say, drink tea and eat scones, talk at length about their theories about what's happening, run from one location to another, save someone, and research an important historical fact. But during another twenty minutes, they don't seem to have enough time to, say, run the length of a block and enter a building. It must be difficult as an author to keep track of this sort of incongruity but this is Brown's special trick and it's irritating that he can't follow his own rules. It needs to be either one way or the other but not both.\n",

I was listening to this on audiobook and I SWEAR, I kept expecting a three year old child to pipe up from somewhere in the back of the crowd, saying, \"Oh, come on, mister! You can't see that?

She's at once brilliant (because obviously Harris-tweed Langdon is a man of taste) but also asks the dumbest questions imaginable to spell things out for the reader. There's an entire scene in the middle where Vittoria literally just parrots the last thing that Langdon says as a question so that he's not monologuing through the solution to a puzzle. There's the stern law enforcement who Langdon, through different manufactured circumstances, has an adversarial relationship against which he has to demonstrate his genius.

Through this, he goes on a relatively interesting hunt for a killer who is staging elaborate murders throughout Rome at sites of artistic importance, with the Vatican under the thread of destruction all the while should he fail. The athletic feats that are demanded from this 40 year old Harvard professor whose exercise routine consists of swimming, is a bit of a stretch, as is his recovery time at the end when, yes, it does feature the worst last line in the world: \"You've never been to bed with a yoga master, have you?\" This is after what is essentially Brown's 10 chapter soliloquy on the relationship of science and religion, proof and faith. There are interesting ideas there and like I said, the elemental based hunt was actually pretty fun, but you really gotta just empty your brain out a little bit and not ask too many questions.\n",

The way he focuses on and writes certain characters is akin to a freeze frame in a movie with a voiceover saying \"hey, pay attention to this detail\" and it all ends in a kind of hilariously melodramatic way that doesn't quite vibe with the rest of the book. The antagonist's motivation and backstory becomes almost a soap opera. It does hook you, even when you scoff at poor decisions made and you have to pause and remember when the book was written due to the incongruence in available technology, but it's fiiine.

      "For a while now, I've heard and read many things, both good and bad, about Dan Brown's books. I decided it was about time to check them out myself. Angels and Demons, the first of the Robert Langdon series, is a book I may never forget. It may be a thriller full of historical facts, but in order to enjoy it, you have to employ one of the key tenents of the science fiction and fantasy genres: a suspension of disbelief. This whole book from start to finish is so utterly ludicrous that if you don't step back and remind yourself that this is a work of fiction, you won't be able to finish it. Somehow, Dan Brown continues to shock you over and over again with how off the wall this book gets as you go along. In fact, this book is so off the wall, it isn't even in the same room anymore let alone still in the same house! I've never read anything that goes off into the deep end like this, especially in the last 100 pages or so. I totally understand where people are coming from when they say that Dan Brown is the master of the \"cheese factor\".\n",

Other than that, all we know are the things he's studied and his thoughts towards the current situation. We don't know anything else about him at all.

In science, we go into variables and in religion we go into myths. Religion, I believe is a way, almost like policing our moralities.

I guess I was just a little disappointed that the Illuminati weren't truly back. The twist was good, don't get me wrong, but there were a few parts to it that I felt were slightly unrealistic.

      "Wow, Dan Brown's writing sure is clunky. His dialogue never seems realistic, the Italian he throws in is awkwardly placed (and sometimes inaccurate), and his dramatic foreshadowing or mood-setting language is often laughable (one notable instance: he provides a dramatic description of the Hassassin's familial and cultural history early in the book. This includes the hitman description, etc. Then Brown spells out that the term hassassin morphed into assassin. Do you really think we need it spelled out?!). Had I had anything else to read, I would have dropped this book in the first 200 or so pages. The second third, however, becomes interesting. I have to give Brown that: I was curious enough that I kept reading. Then, however, it starts to drag in the final third of the book. I got stuck somewhere around the final branding. The poor writing and terrible characterization began to take their toll and I started to skim rather than read. Why didn't Brown's agent or editor insist that he shorten the book? Surely he could've chopped 100 or so pages?\n",

Vittoria is a sexy, fiery Italian physicist. The Hassassin is a bizarre stereotypical bad guy, whose interests are: killing people, sadism, and revenge against the Catholic Church for the crusades (this is all clear early on, so I'm not marking it as a spoiler).

Artificial insemination is considered \"playing God\"/infringing upon the sanctity of life and is therefore not allowed. I can't believe someone who would be made Pope would accept AI - the papacy has been incredibly conservative, and the conservative wing of the church has consolidated power post-Vatican II to prevent further modernization.. \n",

We learn about CERN (and if you're like me and science isn't your strong point, it becomes a little blurry at times) and the Illuminati. After Robert enters Vatican City, the pacing was more to my liking. It's quick enough that I wasn't bored at all, but it still offers so much information and detail along with such a heavy plot.

This book obviously deals heavily with religion, but I think the main reason it was bearable to me is because Brown gives us the science vs religion battle (and even science WITH religion as a possibility) without shoving either opinion down the reader's throat. The only problems I really had with this book wer the length (570 pages seems ludicrous, but then you sort of get sucked into it and want to keep reading it forever) and the similarity to the Da Vinci Code.

There were a few plot holes, a little underdeveloped for the sudden action the character is pushed into with a few unnecessary plots that tangles the story a bit, however it's interesting to read Langdon's roots. Reading from the fourth book down, you can really see how Brown develops the character and the story, especially when you compare Angels & Demons to The Da Vinci Code.

As this is the second book I've read from Dan Brown, I've been able to identified many great techniques from this writer, such as the omniscient narrator presenting one's character's observation on another almost from their own point of view. He makes the judgement subjective so that when the plot twist is revealed later, we feel foolish for trusting the character.

      "I know, I know, I'm really behind the times here. I don't know why but I guess I just never found the time to read Dan Brown or didn't seem interested in it. I remember looking at this book and [b:The Da Vinci Code|968|The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)|Dan Brown|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1303252999s/968.jpg|2982101] when my mom was reading them when I was little and I guess I just put them in the back of my mind as books that wouldn't appeal to me because my mom and I don't have the same taste in books. At least, that's what it was when I was younger because my obsession with Harry Potter was too great that any other adult book seemed super boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever. Off subject. The point is, I FINALLY got my hands on a copy of this book and sat down and read it and WOW. I'm blown away with how great this was. I honestly thought I had the book figured out and knew who it was going to be in the end, but then I was wayyy wrong. I can honestly say I never saw that coming and I LOVE that in a book.\n",

      "First off, I just want to say hats off to Dan Brown because anyone that can squeeze out 500 pages with a time span of about 24 hours, with a majority of the novel happening in just 4 hours, more power to you. All hail the mighty pen you wrote that with, because that's just plain impressive. And it was never repetitive or boring or seemed like there was an overwhelming amount of detail that took away from the brilliance of the book. The pace was great even though it might seem like it would be slow because it takes 500 pages to cover just a few short hours, whereas most books have a long period of time in 300 pages. So that was genius in itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire plot was just amazing. I can't stop raving at how smart it was. The writing was crisp and entertaining but overall, it was just an intelligent book. It really made me think and I honestly appreciated all the historical facts in there, whether they were true or not. Even if they weren't, it all made logical sense the way he wrote it. I love when you can fit things into concrete history--like an entire secret society conspiracy--and it actually works in the context you've given it. You have to do a lot of research to make those things seem historically accurate even when they're not, and I appreciate the knowledge that was had to be able to write this book. It was very detailed and in depth and incredibly well thought out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters were great and real too. I never once doubted their actions or thought they were behaving out of line. There was some character development, which I think is hard to do considering they only were in the novel for a few hours and you can't really change who you are, but they all behaved consistently. Once again, things just made sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's talk about a plot twist! I was convinced from about 100 pages in that Max Kohler was behind everything and was almost kind of disappointed when it all pointed to him when he went to talk to the camerlengo. For as well written as the entire book was, I didn't want it to end so predictably in the sense that I was suspicious of this character the whole time and then oh, it's him, no surprise there. Then all of a sudden it took a turn and I was definitely not ready for the camerlengo to be behind it all. If anything, I thought Mortati was going to be it, even though he was locked in with all the cardinals and would not be able to communicate with the press or anyone. I was kind of glad that he was the Devil's Advocate because I didn't want to be completely wrong in my instincts that there was something different about him. But damn, really did not see that coming at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint about the book is the ending. Brown kind of skimmed over how the camerlengo and Langdon survived the helicopter. He had Langdon's fall described in detail, but I'm pretty damn skeptical that he would survive that. There's just no way you can hit the water from that height and live. It would be like smacking into concrete, even if he was trying to slow down with the makeshift parachute. That was one of the only unrealistic moments in the book. And it never quite explained how the camerlengo survived the helicopter and antimatter either, so that whole section right there just didn't really add up for me.\n",

      "Angels & Demons poses many theological and scientific questions. A war between science and religion. There were so many questions, so many facts (art history, tombs, tunnels, architecture in Rome) along with Illuminati - did it really exist??? How about the Catholic Church - the politics, the pope election...fact? Hmmm...my brain is spinning, trying to make sense, trying to understand. There is a huge part of me that is cringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why cringe? I cringe whenever I read something that seems to try and portray us humans (science, what ever) as more powerful and knowledgeable than God. I hold a great respect for the institution of religion...of the Catholic Church. However, I am not so naive to know that the Catholic Church at one point was very powerful in the world of politics, history, the building of nations, the downfall of individuals who want to speak out for their faith that was different from the Catholics. Regardless, the core is that they do believe in Christ Jesus as our Savior so I do have a respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did, however, find the story interesting. I found myself caught up in the intrigue, the mystery, the action. I found that I read this book at a slower pace than usual as I needed time to process the story - the information. The beginning, due to huge amount of information was a bit slow but around pg 236 I found that my heart started to pound. The story became intense. I had to finish...I had to know what happens.\n",
      "4.0\n",
      "Como ya he dicho en varias ocasiones, me ha hace muchísima gracia que todos los best-seller reciban las críticas masivas de eruditos en todas partes del mundo. Dan Brown no se libra, y compré este libro sabiendo que abundan las críticas a su obra. Qué queréis qu os diga, pero yo he disfrutado la lectura. No sabía lo que ocurría ya que no he visto nunca la adaptación, y me ha parecido intrigante y muy entretenido. ¿Hay libros mejores del género? No digo que no, pero ¿tendría tantas críticas negativas de no haber sido un pelotazo tras la primera adaptación? Seguro que no.\n",

      "After what seemed like a thousand years, I finally finished this book. (Blame the bad old slumps!)\n",
      "I'd say generally it was good. Aside from a similar plot structure, I liked the history behind the events.\n",
      "It certainly was interesting reading about the Illuminati, and I am glad that it was a fast-paced book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Full\" review :P\n",
      "Having loved The Da Vinci Code, needless to say, I did have quite an expectation for this book. It did not disappoint to the extreme point, yet it wasn't good enough in comparison. I feel like that the basic plot progression can be quite similar to the others in the series, but I guess I'll make a final decision on that after I read Origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, I was so baffled by the amazing mystery/puzzle solving skills of Robert Langdon. It was so satisfying to see problems coming to a solution. In addition, I was able to grab some quick facts along the way, which was a big bonus for me. All this in a book? Oh boy, I was intrigued. (Psst, if there's any more of these books that you know of, do recommend them to me! I am definitely in to read them)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another part that I did enjoy about this book is that how it talked about the mixture of science and religion. Being able to read about history was a big reason why I liked The Da Vinci Code, so the reason also applied to this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I stated before, the reason for a 3.75 rating rather than a 4 or above is that the plot was somehow too expectable. If it wasn't for that, I would certainly rate this book much higher.\n",
      "4.0\n",
      "Enjoyable till the end! I couldn't put it down. Anybody who enjoys a good thriller with a high IQ should read this. My only problem was that I wanted more closure towards the end of the book.\n",
      "5.0\n",
      "Famed symbologist Robert Langdon appears in this struggle between science and religion. So many twists, you'll forget which way is up. This one takes place before The Da Vinci Code and, in my opinion, is better.\n",

      "It was very similar to Davinci Code. Both are very good books but don't read them back-to-back.\n",
      "2.0\n",
      "Not one to typically read a mystery crime novel, but I enjoyed this one. The use of religious symbology captivated me. My biggest issue is realising half way through that a lot of the references were fabricated, or \"creatively\" altered. It didn't ruin the story as a work of fiction, but I can't say it didn't take some of the wonder out of it. Of course, there are aspects that are true, and I did learn a few things. If you're someone interested in the history of Rome, the Catholic Church and the Illuminati, you will have to put the book down to do some fact checking before you go repeating cool \"facts\" you've learnt. But don't let that wreck the book for you, it still stands up well.\n",
      "5.0\n",
      "Final Review:\n",
      "ehh...this was a bit of a disappointment. The concept was extremely interesting - the possibility of intimate connections between religion and science, and what happens when they become adversaries - and through the first three quarters the story held incredible promise. Then, it all sort of...fell apart. The story should have ended much sooner than it actually did, and the level of ridiculousness that it reached was worthy of one of Jack Bauer's most frenzied episodes. Finally, many of the plot \"twists\" were thoroughly predictable - I saw them coming for miles. For a more enjoyable, less ridiculous caper, I think Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code would win in a competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original Review:\n",
      "So far, I'm really enjoying it, perhaps better than \"The Da Vinci Code\" because of its sci-fi dimension. Just don't accept any of it as authentic history, no matter what Dan Brown says to the contrary, because like Da Vinci Code, it simply isn't.\n",

      "Somehow I missed this series when it first became popular. I got [b:The Da Vinci Code|968|The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)|Dan Brown|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1303252999s/968.jpg|2982101] then I found it was not the first in the series. But Angels and Demons got pushed to the bottom of my list, and then I forgot about for a few years. So I just now got around to reading it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angels and Demons was a very fast-paced thriller. It was an exciting combination of conspiracy theory, European history, religion versus science, and good ole get-the-bad-guy action. Since I am not a historian, theologian, or Italian, I do not know how accurate the details of the book are. To the untrained eye, it seems there was enough research done to make a believable back story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nice to have a slightly nerdy underdog for a hero. Langdon's primary weapon was his mind and his extensive knowledge base on symbology and history. He is also an accomplished swimmer which keeps the character from falling into the stereotype of all brains and no brawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked that there was a strong female lead as well. Although, Vittoria Vetra falls into the sexy scientist category. While I liked her character in the beginning, she felt flatter as the story went on. She went from the intelligent scientist to side kick to damsel in distress. I wish she had more character development even though she wasn't the main character.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a little dizzying to look back and realize that the entire book takes place over a twenty-four hour period. My head would probably pop if I went through that many traumatic/suspenseful events in such a short time. Yet Brown makes it work. At times it feels like there is an almost unbelievable amount of events crammed into one book/one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "There did seem to be a substantial number of chapters. With 137 chapters, this has to be one of the highest amount of chapters I have seen in a novel. Each chapter only a few pages and most of them end with mini cliffhangers. Normally, I don't get very absorbed in books with multiple points of view. But it was surprisingly easily to follow even with the constant switching. And there was almost no down time so I never got bored. It was definitely a page-turner. No, the writing was not very descriptive, but the story was good. I can see why it is such a popular series.\n",

      "I did get annoyed that they find three of the four Cardinals alive yet are unable to save them. Having finished, I understand that saving any of them would have ruined the big reveal at the ending. But it was frustrating for them to be on time yet still to late to say them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard that this book took a lot of flack for anti-religious writing. Having read the story, it doesn't seem anti-religious. Rather it points out that the fields of both religion and science are comprised of mankind. And mankind makes many mistakes.\n",

It should be noted that this was his FIRST book with this character & has definitely crafted the character & plots in more recent iterations.\n",

      "It has just opened my mind not only to culture and art, I have learnt more about that on this book than in any one lesson at school, but it has expanded my mind and completely changed the way I view religion. I'm not a very religious person, I will say that I believe in God or a higher power but I have never believed in following his rules and I hardly ever pray or go to church. I believed (and to a certain extent still do believe) that people who are too religious are ignorant to science and fact and that so many of the worlds problems, war, terrorism...etc are created by religious leaders who cause destruction and horror supposedly in the name of god. I have blamed religion for a lot of the worlds problems.\n",

      "The writing at the beginning was complicated and since I don't have a great vocabulary, I often had to pause to look up the meaning of a word but as I went on I completely forgot about the plot and I just wanted to keep reading. It's not till the very very end that everything gets sorted out, and even when you think everything is alright the biggest twist on them all takes place.\n",

      "I was satisfied with the ending but I can see why some people may not have been. I too wished that the world found out the truth but I think that in the end it really was for the greater good.

      "This is so cool after finishing the book and going back to review it: the \"Angels and Demons\" blank page is written as an anagram!\n",
      "\n",
      "The prologue describes a man (we learn is Leonardo Vetra) being tortured for a password and then branded. The story starts with Robert Langdon receiving a series of phone calls from Maximilian Kohler for him to come meet with him immediately. He knows about his book, \"The Art of The Illuminati\" and claims to have gotten his phone number from his website, which Robert doesn't think he put there. Because it's 5:00 in the morning, he refuses Kohler's offer. As he thinks to himself, we learn that he is a professor of symbology at Harvard and likes to swim laps there. Soon after the call, Langdon is faxed a picture of the Illuminati anagram (you can read it upside down identically) and a dead man.\n",
      "After some more talking with Kohler, Robert goes to the Boston airport, expecting an hour flight, but he is surprised to see a rocket-like object to take him to Geneva, Switzerland (not in Geneva, NY like he thought)... it apparently flies and does it really quickly.\n",
      "The POV switches to a killer talking on the phone with Janus and sounds really creepy. I was thinking (it mentions this in the book, too) about the greek god Janus, the two-faced man... kind-of foreshadowing after looking back on it. They occasionally switch back to him, doing some pretty weird stuff.\n",
      "When Langdon lands, he reaches CERN, a European nuclear research group. Maximilian Kohler is an old man that zooms up in a wheelchair to meet him... we are inclined to have a bad feeling about this man, and the fact that he could be Mr. Curtain's twin (LOL (from Mysterious Benedict Society)) made me super suspicious that he was a really bad guy. As they're walking through the halls, Langdon realizes that it's a really serious/studious place but all of the young people there throwing frisbees with various college sweatshirts made it seem like a university... there's even a plaque stating that they invented the worldwide web. Some of the sentences in this book cracked me up, \"'I see,' Langdon said, not seeing at all.\"\n",
      "Kohler seems kind of obsessed with disproving religion... he makes a whole \"speech\" about how science is the answer to everything and stuff...\n",
      "It turns out that Leonardo Vetra was the man who was killed. Kohler didn't call the police and has only notified Vittoria, Leonardo's daughter. He says that the used a freezing system to preserve the body... this really makes you think that this dude killed him.\n",
      "Then, Langdon explains who the Illuminati really are (* to * is the story of the Illuminati, disregarding the plot of this book)...\n",
      "\n",
      "*They were a group of scientists (Illuminati = \"the enlightened ones\") in the 1500s who were on the quest for scientific truth. Many of the followers wanted to violently rise against the church, but their main leader was a pacifist and didn't want to cause any problems (Galileo), because he was a devoted catholic as well. He claimed that science and the church were allies... cold and hot were like heaven and the other place... but the church didn't want to be friends. After Galileo was put under house arrest for heresy, the Illuminati rebelled but four members were captured and didn't say a thing, even after being tortured and branded with a cross. They burned them after brutally murdering them, showing the people of Rome to not mess with the church and not to join the Illuminati. Then, the group went into hiding and re-emerged as a violent, anti-Christian group, because they tortured some of their members, and the church started calling them, Shaitan (Satan in Islam (a language they didn't like)). The Illuminati went from being a group of scientists to an anti-Christian, secretive cult. When the group fled Rome, they were taken in by the Freemasons, a secretive society of stone craftsmen. They weren't violent either, but when they were joined by the Illuminati, they were seen just as evil. Because they had infiltrated the Masons, they then were connected to George Washington and Benjamin Franklin (unaware of the Illuminati connection) and started banks and got other businesses to finance their ultimate quest: the creation of a secular \"New World Order\" based on scientific enlightenment. They called it their Luciferian Doctrine, who they thought was intended to represent its Latin meaning (bringer of light), or Illuminator.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Langdon thinks that the Illuminati are very likely not around anymore, that some other group probably just took their symbols/brands to use, and that the Illuminati wouldn't kill a fellow scientist anyway. Then, Maxilimilian shows Langdon Vetra's office and explains that he was also a Catholic priest, which now makes sense for him to have been killed. The man was trying to prove that science and God were linked... the particles in every person are connected by a force, and it apparently is \"better evidence of God than religion itself.\" They go back to look at his body, and Langdon is shown that his eye was removed, but Robert thinks that this is random murder, which isn't like the Illuminati at all.\n",
      "Then, Vittoria arrives (Italian and pretty) and Langdon seems to like her. She doesn't want anyone to look in the lab anymore, because what they were working on was private between her and her dad. CERN apparently has their own particle accelerator (throwback to eight grade science), which is about sixteen miles long. A camera was also stolen and moved somewhere in CERN (signal still working). We learn about Vittoria's past... she was adopted by her father at a Catholic home, and they loved talking about science with each other.\n",
      "At the door to Leonardo's lab, Vittoria opens the door with her eye (retina scan)... she is the only one besides her father who can open it. Kohler didn't know that they changed the lock, and Langdon is glad that she didn't see the dried blood. She explains that her dad was trying to prove how the universe started.. basically, he created matter out of nothing (anti-matter), proving science and religion. It is in a container, suspended by a magnetic field on either side of the canister, but if it comes in contact with matter (EX: the side of the canister), then it would explode and bad stuff would happen. If it is removed from its charger, then it only has a 24 hour life.\n",
      "They didn't tell CERN about their experiment, because they thought the board would misinterpret its purpose. Their biggest specimen of antimatter (1/4 gram) is stored in the bedrock storage room, and they just wanted to keep a good sized sample safe.\n",
      "The go down to the HAZ-MAT chamber, and the sample is gone, and an eyeball is left. I realized that the epitome of the enemy of the Illuminati is the leader of the Catholic church... the pope at the Vatican. Vittoria tries to call Interpol even though Kohler doesn't want her to (risk CERN's reputation), but she wants the professionals to help... sadly, her phone isn't getting service down there.\n",
      "There is another lady in Kohler's office, but she can't reach him (no internet connection where he is), so she just makes an announcement. Kohler starts having some kind of breathing problem when they get back to internet range, and he tells them to go to the Vatican to get the canister. They're in the plane, and Langdon shows her some Illuminati symbology on the dollar bill\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*the pyramid represents a delta (science), and the eye above it represents how the Illuminati watches all things. In latin, the phrase below it says, \"New World Order,\" contradicting \"In God We Trust\" beside it. VP Henry Wallance probably told F. Roosevelt that it meant, \"New Deal,\" but then Roosevelt was also a Mason.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Random: Robert's watch is a Mickey Mouse to remind him to be young at heart. When they're flying above the Vatican, Langdon thinks about how it's 15 days after the pope died, so all of the cardinals are in the one place to have a meeting, which has never been interrupted.\n",
      "They meet with Olivetti, who clearly doesn't like them, and they show the camera filming the canister somewhere unknown in the Vatican. They have under an hour until conclave starts and until midnight for the battery to run out on the canister... how dramatic. The Swiss Guard (protects the Vatican) basically refuses to do a formal search for the canister.\n",
      "They go up to talk to the Carlemengo. They get a call from a mystery man who says that besides the fact that they're going to level Vatican City by midnight, they have the four missing, favorite cardinals. One of them is the favorite (perforate), Cardinal Baggia, to become the pope, so they really want to find them. Because the church branded four Illuminati scientists, they will publicly brand and murder the four cardinals every hour until midnight. POV switches to Cardinal Mortati, who is leading the conclave, and they're nervous about the missing cardinals.\n",
      "The Carlemengo doesn't want them to free the cardinals and that they should just start Conclave. Robert has been trying to get access to these archives for years, and he thinks the answer is there, so he heads down after being granted access by the Carlemengo (starting to like him a lot).\n",
      "Robert and Vittoria look for a book by Galileo and \"the sign\" to the Church of Illumination in it. The path of Illumination was for the followers that came to Rome to be able to find the church... like a treasure hunt. They used religious sculptures to mark it so that the church would never suspect it (even though it was Galileo's Illuminati... nicer than current one)... they looked religious but really represented one of the four elements: earth, air fire, and water. Four cardinals, four symbols on the path... they will publicly execute each one at each marker.\n",
      "POV switches to the Carlemengo Carlo Vantresca reminiscing about his mother's death in some kind of explosion of a church (he was the only survivor.\n",
      "POV switches to Gunther Glick on pope watch at the Vatican with Chinita videoing. They get a call from an Arabian man (we assume the killer from before) telling him about where to go to get the best footage for something special.\n",
      "POV switches to Robert and Vittoria in the archives, and the Illuminati \"special number\" is 503... they start talking about one of Galileo's books that was secretly popular (maybe how the word got out about the path of Illumination). It was printed on paper that would dissolve in water to protect the followers, book \"Diagramma\". Roman numeral for 503 is DIII, so they're looking for the book in special spots where the Vatican may have put it, and only 8% humidity in the new room. They find it and start looking for writings about math (universal language... Illuminati may easily understand it). On page five, there's a footnote (five = pentagrams... Illuminati), \"The path of light is laid, the sacred test.\" They find four lines around the page, a poem by John Milton. Langdon wants to copy the lines down (and was careful to use gloves, tongs, and a spatula), but Vittoria just plucks the paper withe her gloved hands and rushes out. Part of the poem said, \"Santi's tomb,\" so Robert thinks that it's Raphael's tomb (Raphael Santi), which is at the Pantheon.\n",
      "They are driven there by Olivetti and the rest of the Swiss guard, act as newlywed tourists, and are followed around by a fact-filled history geek. Vittoria goes and looks at the tomb, but the date when his body was placed there was a century after the Diagramma was published, so they realize that they're at the wrong place. After lots of talking and help from the geeky dude, the deduce that it must be a church that Raphael designed, Capella della Terra (\"earth\"... I knew that from French) AKA Chigi Chapel.\n",
      "When they get there and walk around and talk a bunch, they realize that there's a mosaic on the floor and a spot like a manhole has a cover to the side and smells really bad. Langdon climbs down a ladder on the side of the pit... the man is buried waist-deep in dirt and probably died from his mouth being stuffed with more earth. In addition, the \"Earth\" ambigram is branded on his chest.\n",
      "They figure out that Catholic favorite Bernini actually laid out the path of Illumination and designed things within the Vatican. The last line of the poem from the Diagramma said to follow the angel on the quest, and the statue of an angel is pointing one way, so they figure out churches in the line of the pointing finger and sculptures by Bernini.\n",
      "They realize that it must be in St. Peter's Square, a public place with a sculpture depicting the breath of God (air). I was thinking about Greek mythology... earth is like Gaea, the earth mother, and her son is Kronos, the dad of the \"Big Three...\" Zeus could be air, Poseidon could be water, and Hades could be fire. Meanwhile, Glick and his partner are working on getting footage of the body and are now following the Swiss Guard's cars.\n",
      "Apparently, a man was \"helping\" the old man, but they realize now that he had killed the man (the cardinal). His lungs were punctured, too, when they tried CPR. Gunther's camerawoman got it all on tape and ran off. They catch up to her, but Gunther slips the footage out of her pocket, but no one else sees him preserve it.\n",
      "They go back to the Vatican to wash up, but they're having a hard time thinking of anything in the line that has to do with fire or even obelisks. Everyone is shocked by the footage and information that BBC is sharing, and they want Captain Rocher to keep looking for antimatter and want the Conclave to evacuate (Carlemango refuses). Gunther announces (probably all information from their call with the killer) that the pope was killed by Heparin and didn't die in his sleep, and the Carlemengo says that he got a daily injection. It is often mistaken for a stroke, but a way to tell (according to Vittoria, who looks at this in sea mammals) is if they have a black mouth inside. Robert goes back down to the archives to look for a list of Bernini's works. Meanwhile, there have been two failed votes for pope, probably because they're waiting to see if the rest of the cardinals survive. Kohler reads Vittoria's journal and examines the office. Vittoria learns that the Carlemengo was the adopted son of the late pope and was in the military for two years.\n",
      "In the archives, Robert is trapped, because someone had turned off the power (the door is all automatic). Vittoria, Carlemengo, and some of the Swiss Guard are going down to look at the pope... you're not supposed to touch the body or perform an autopsy after, but when they look at his tongue, it's black (= overdose of his injection).\n",
      "In the archives, Langdon is loosing air and is rocking back and forth to knock over the bookshelves and smash the glass, and he's really mad when he finally gets to reach Olivetti with his walkie-talkie. Max calls Vittoria, and he claims that her father did tell someone about the antimatter, even though they swore to never tell anyone.\n",
      "Janus and the killer talk, and he wants Langdon and Vittoria to be eliminated, but he thinks about kidnapping her... Meanwhile, the Swiss Guard and others are on their way to Plaza Barberini for the \"fire.\" The church is apparently under construction, but a woman saw an Arab go inside, and they see fire glowing inside. Langdon tries to get the man suspended above the fire down, but he can't and he falls in, branded. The assassin takes Vittoria, and Langdon hies under an overturned coffin, and he sets an alarm with his watch that saves his life.\n",
      "Back at the Vatican, the Carlemengo says that he gives in to science, and he makes a huge speech about how religion lives on. Meanwhile, the assassin has taken Vittoria to a secret place, and Robert is still trapped.\n",
      "They've agreed that if the church is still in peril at 11:15, then they will evacuate the cardinals with dignity into the streets. POV back to Langdon with the firefighters who rescued him... they give him a map, and he realizes that the three spots make a triangle, and a fourth could make a diamond (Illuminati diamond was kind of oblong and they loved the symmetry). He realizes that it's at the Fountain of the Four Rivers, but his walkie talkie doesn't connect...\n",
      "He's nervous and kind-of goes crazy and holds his gun up to a man in a sedan and takes his car... I was like whoa there can't you just ask for a ride with the firefighters??\n",
      "Anyway, about 15 minutes before 11:00, a black van without any headlights on drives up to the fountain. He has Cardinal Baggia tied up with heavy chains, and they talk a little bit before the assassin makes the point that it isn't a Hollywood movie where they talk it out before killing each other (LOL thank you for someone saying it), and that Vittoria is at the Church of Illumination. Langdon shoots the assassin's toe after he pushes the cardinal in, and they start bloodily fighting in the water. The cardinal is too heavy for Langdon, and then the assassin fights him... the cardinal sinks and dies, but Langdon gets a hold of a rubber bubble maker for some air... noice. Langdon swims laps and can hold his breath, so when he fakes his death, the assassin drives away and Langdon cries after five minutes of failed CPR attempts on Baggia. After getting out of the fountain, Robert sees a dove (symbolizing an enlightened soul), and he knows to go to the Castle of the Angel based on where it's pointing.\n",
      "Robert meets an Australian guy with a TV truck at the building who says that a black van has been going in and out all night (wow he's a SMART one... wouldn't he think about what's going on and try to get footage??). Anyway, Langdon trades him information about what happened and where to find Baggia in exchange to climb up his $200,000 ladder attatched to the car. On his way rushing through the building, Robert sees jail cells and black robes where they must have held the cardinals.\n",
      "He reaches Vittoria and the assassin, and he sees a pentagon-shaped box with the five brands and a square spot, empty, for the sixth brand. The assassin says that the brand is waiting for the ultimate target, and Robert thinks it's the Carlemengo (I was thinking either him or the dead pope). Then he says that the only person going in the Varican is the one who has an appointment, who is Rocher, expecting to bring back helpful information. They both fight the assassin, and Vittoria gives a final thrust with a torch, sending him off the balcony and crashing into a pile of cannonballs below. They rush through the square to see Max zooming to the Vatican. He waits outside of the office with Rocher, and he goes in (meanwhile, we learn that his parents wouldn't let him have medicine and to have faith... the only reason why he didn't fully heal is apparently because he had medicine). Plus, BBC said that CERN is the new Illuminati lair.\n",
      "A guard goes and unlocks the door to the secret passageway connecting to the Vatican, letting Vittoria and Robert inside. The carlemengo screams inside his office, door opens, he points at Rocher, \"ILLUMINATUS,\" Kohler dies/gives Robert something to give to the media, and Carlemengo has the final brand on his chest. They take him outside, and he leaps up, exposing the brand we now see that spells the elements. He seems to think he's talking to God and runs back in, \"Upon this rock I will build my church,\" goes to the Necropolis (underground special burial site) to St. Peter's tomb where they realize the antimatter is. Carlemengo and Langdon jump in the helicopter intended to take him to the hospital with antimatter. Carlemengo takes only parachute, jumps out, Landgon jumps without\n",

      "The prequel to the popular The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons is the thriller of all thrillers. Right from the first page the story takes off, taking the reader on a ride like no other. The majority of the book takes place over one day, taking unimaginable and highly suspenseful twists and turns. A religious symbolist, Robert Langdon, finds himself pulled into what appears to be one of the oldest conflicts in history involving the Illuminati and the Catholic Church. It is science versus religion. Or can the two exist together? Langdon teams up with a physicist, Vittoria Vetra, and the two set out to solve a life and death puzzle that will ultimately result in the death of the Vatican City if they fail. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author, Dan Brown, did his research for this book and on every page it shows. The controversy between science and religion and whether or not the two can exist harmoniously is a very real struggle in today’s society, and Mr. Brown touched upon vital points on both sides of the fence. Although I hope not to spoil the endings of books in my brief reviews (and I will try not to do so here), I must say that this book totally surprised me with the turn it took in the end, something that is not so easy to do anymore. I look forward to reading The Da Vinci Code and only hope that it lives up the reputation of Angels and Demons as everyone has been saying.\n",

There were a lot of plot twists, especially toward the end, and I loved how real historical landmarks and documents were included.

      "This is the second book I've read by Dan Brown (the first, unsurprisingly was The Da Vinci Code) and I've come away from both feeling rather cheated. About halfway through the book, when I found myself in front of the computer confirming that Brown had gotten yet ANOTHER \"fact\" incorrect, I decided I needed to change my outlook or I'd never get through it. My recommendation for anyone reading ANY of his books is to pretend you're reading an alternate history. Same planet, same countries, same basic structure, but different. A parallel universe, if you will, where Brown's theories, translations and descriptions are simply true. Once I decided on that, I found I was able to actually enjoy the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know a lot of people have issues with Brown's writing style, but I find him a perfectly competent storyteller, and one with a definite flair for the dramatic. While some parts of his mysteries are fairly easily solved, he builds enough suspense that even when you think you know what's coming, it doesn't lessen your reaction. As long as you can keep suspending your disbelief, then he's really not a bad writer. And I would definitely recommend this book over Da Vinci. For one thing, it actually comes first chronologically, so you can meet Robert Langdon properly. And secondly, it's just better written. The co-worker from whom I borrowed the book said it best when he felt that certain *something* all authors have in their debut novels that they don't have for their later ones. It's just fresher, and the story - quite frankly - better.\n",

I do find this novel to be entertaining; Robert Langdon using his knowledge of the Illuminati and his book smarts to solve crime and hunt down a killer while the Vatican (and religion as a whole) is in a major transistional period in its history. But I think that it comes to easily. And the pretty bow that everything is tied up with in the end makes the investment the reader has in the novel not pay back in full.

      "I don't even know where to begin. I normally don't write reviews, only when a book was extraordinarily great or absolutely gruesome. From my rating I'm sure you can tell which was the case for this one. This book is the impersonation of exactly that bigotry, that sometimes make me lose faith in this world.\n",
      "First of all I want to begin with the Assassin. Yes, assassin and not hassassin. I was quite confused when I read that an Islamic order was named after its drug excesses. Islam forbids any kind of drug use or smoking. Haram. So I decided to google it and LITERALLY the first paragraph, second sentence on Wikipedia over Assassins: \"Based on texts from Alamut, their grand master Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples Asāsiyyūn (أساسيون, meaning \"people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]\"), but some foreign travellers like Marco Polo misunderstood the name as deriving from the term hashish.\" How hard could it have been to do a tiny bit of research before writing or publishing something like that? Also could this character be anymore stereotypical? The evil Arab, who is sadistic and misogynistic. Just what we needed, because that is totally not the single story that literally every white author (including those in the media) tells about Arabs. The more you hear it, the more you believe it. Stop spreading hate and directing it to those that have already suffered the most (because Western countries like to take their homes as a playground to fight their wars).\n",
      "But even though this is in my opinion the worst stereotype that is bestowed, it is far from being the only one! Let's continue with \"The Scorning Scientist, Who Despises Religion\". I can guarantee you that from all scientist, those that work at CERN, or generally in physics, are the most religious ones. Because they know better than anybody else what exactly science will never be able to explain about the world. Except for maybe philosophers they are the ones that think the most about the question \"Why is there something and not nothing?\" All they do is trying to understand God's work as good as possible. And I am surely not saying that there are no atheistic or agnostic physicists, all I am saying is that the people at CERN are definitely not going to celebrate the death/murder of the pope.\n",
      "Next thing: the sexism and misogyny. Vittoria Vetra is the next embodied stereotype that made me want to throw up, while reading this book. The strong, independent, intelligent, and empowered woman that needs a man (to save her). That Dan Brown is trying to sell her as a progressive woman, that is not just smarter than the male protagonist, but can also fight better makes it even worse that he then writes things like \"in that moment she just wanted to be hold in his strong arms\". Pretty much any interaction between Langdon and Vittoria was terrible, and that is tbh most of the book. And please don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no problem with love stories, but I do have a problem with sexism. Women don't need men and men are not the antidote to all our problems. Company makes things for sure better, but we ain't no flowers thirsty for water.\n",

The amount of information in this book is maddening, and yet it is never tiring and it never feels like it drags on. The exact opposite, each small fact or huge revalation stays with the reader throughout the story, like the riddles towards an even greater mystey.\n",
      "♦ A skull-cracking mystery, serial killings, the fate of the Catholic church crumbling, the world watching in shock. This book has so much page-turning action that even thinking about it now, it still steals my breath away. I kept guessing and guessing and it got me nowhere, until when I found out the truth, everything suddenly made sense.\n",
      "♦ Complex, well-thought characters, and an absolutely charming dymanic between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Their relationship, the way they completed each other and the way their thoughts crossed and their knowledge tangled was an absolute delight to read about.\n",
      "♦ A villain that had me press a hand on my mouth and widen my eyes in shock, as the motives, the feelings and the entire psychological complexity were absolutely unbelievable.\n",
      "♦ A trip in Rome that made me feel like I knew the place, even if I've never been there. Everything was described and thought of in such detail that it all seemed familiar in some way, making me even more eager to follow the story.\n",
      "♦ The entire atmosphere of lung squeezing stress the book gave me, that made me fly through and still think about it long after I had finished. Bonus because the multiple POVs worked in a very good way.\n",

I will be visiting Rome next month and now I’m even more excited. This story featured so many landmarks and churches that are now definitely on my list of places to travel.

Brown paces the book to feel almost like a literary action movie with a cast of likeable characters and more twists and turns than an English B road. His treatment of female characters is a little archaic but not offensively so, more product of the early naughties. I'm usually good at guessing the twist in a novel but this one took me by surprise because it is a very twisty novel.

Langdon was there himself when Baggia died, he shed tears for the man; shouldn't he want to do the man justice more than anyone? I can understand how the truth could have ruined faith for a lot of people, but it's like Ventresca got away with his awful actions - yes the man was disturbed and he'd had an awful past, surviving an attack where his own mother died but it's like Ventresca ended his days like a man to be honored and what he did was awful; He maybe got a man to do it but in theory he killed Vittoria's father, Olivetti and the four Prefiriti and not quickly.. He made them suffer and I really feel like they died for nothing. It's not okay!

I mean, people were being brutally murdered left and right and they were trying to stop a bomb that was more destructive than a nuke. The stakes in The Da Vinci Code was that a singular secret was (maybe) going to be revealed/forgotten by history (as it already had been). The pace of the book felt slightly faster because of the increased action and stakes and Langdon had less time to preach about symbology.\n",

      "Obviously this book is far from perfect. As I mentioned before, Dan Brown really can't write. He tried to weave some complex themes throughout the book but, in my opinion, his writing is too ham-fisted to execute it. Things were also a bit too convenient at times and the characters had a few too many skills that were just perfect to get the characters out of whatever danger they were in. Also, words cannot describe how cringe-inducing the ~romance~ between Langdon and Vittoria was. Still, despite all reason, I really, really liked this. I don't know if I'd recommend this to people I know, but if you like Dan Brown-esque writers (aka, Dad-lit) then you'd love this.\n",

      "This is the first Dan Brown novel I have read, and at first I wasn't a huge fan. It was good but it wasn't great. The writing was well done, and the plot made sense, and the history surrounding it was cool. I liked it fine enough, but not outstanding to me right away. The characters weren't that great in my eyes, just solid characters, nothing too wildly special. Overall I figured it was just an okay novel, until the end. The end really made this book crazy good! I didn't think I would like this novel halfway through, but the ending was so interesting and twisted that everything made sense and I ended up enjoying so, so much! I'm so glad I held out and finished it, because it was worth it. I definitely plan to read The Da Vinci Code.\n",

Although obviously better written than shameful series like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Gray, the writing in this book was lackluster. It was as if Dan Brown took one writing class, made a list of generic writing techniques, and then tried to implement them all. Okay... maybe it was better than that, but the character development was not much to rave about, and the writing was too repetitious. I felt like I was watching a reality TV show that has to do a summary after every commercial. I doubt I'll read another book by Langdon, but this book was still intriguing enough to where I felt the need to finish it. I enjoyed the history and the plot twists. They're what really kept the story going for me.\n",

At times, in fact, it managed to move me spiritually as I considered my own beliefs about life and god.\n",

      "Dan Brown is my favourite author, and as I expected, this book didn't fail to impress me. It follows the search of a new CERN discovery, the antimatter. Robert Langdon is called by Maxmilian Kohler after an unusual death which is represented by an Illuminati symbol. Robert Langdon flies to the Vatican with Vittoria Vetra, the daughter of the murder victim. Together they follow a complicated course covering the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, hoping to find the culprit. After 4 papas are killed, Robert Langdon finally locates Illuminati's location successfully, also saving Vittoria, who has been kidnapped, and killing the supposed murderer. When I had reached this point of the book, I thought the action was about to come to an end because I was starting to feel sorry for all that these 2 poor characters had to go through. But no, the action seemed like it just started. Maximilian Kohler meets up with Carlo Ventresca, the replacing pope in absence of a papa, and all the evidence after the meeting points at Maximilian being the Illuminati killer. The antimatter is still nowhere to be found, so after Ventresca has a \"revelation\" and finds it, he and Robert fly in a helicopter to get the container as far from the Vatican as possible. Ventresca abandons Robert in the helicopter after jumping out with a parachute and Robert somehow survives the fall through landing in water. Everyone treats Ventresca like a Messiah, but Robert finally realizes the murderer has been under his nose the whole time, him being Ventresca. After he is confronted, the culprit sets himself on fire and Mortati becomes the new papa.\n",
      "This book is PACKED with action and plot-twists. At first, I was a bit disappointed thinking that this book would turn out to be way too predictable, but Brown knows how to use the shock element as always. In my opinion, this book is far from predictable and I can't ever get enough of Dan Brown's writing style. He puts science inside fiction, he keeps the story always on a significant tangent with reality and he transfers the reader in a deep state inside the book's action. The romance between Robert and Vittoria is nicely developed along with the other thriller events, also keeping the book far from a love story at the same time. The last chapter makes a beautiful light-hearted ending after a book filled with tension. Overall, this book was an amazing masterpiece which I would definitely re-read.\n",

The historical tie-ins, puzzles, religious elements, codes, scientific references, art, and architectural elements- all blend together to make for a real gripping page turner. The stories have mystery, suspense, danger, drama, action, adventure, clues, puzzles, and an element of good vs. evil.\n",
      "The series is based on Robert Langdon, who is a Harvard Professor of symbology and religious iconology. It is he who we follow on epic adventures, unravelling clues, solving puzzles, making discoveries, with danger ever present.\n",
      "This story/series shouldn’t be over-thought, I think going in blind and immersing yourself in the story is the best way to have a pleasurable reading experience. I try not to buy into the hype, the critical comments, or the conspiracy theories- I just try to enjoy the story- which really isn’t hard to do, because it/they really are extremely well done. While there isn’t a great deal of character growth and development in the story/series, there really isn’t a need for it because the story makes up for that.\n",
      "Dan Brown has a great formula for writing interesting, thought provoking, and suspenseful thrillers that contain plenty of twists and surprises. He has a knack for keeping his readers on the edge of our seat, anticipating what will happen next- which makes his stories quite entertaining and memorable.\n",
      "In this story Robert Langdon is pitted against the Illuminati, who has a vendetta against the Catholic Church. It is a race against the clock, through catacombs, crypts, cathedrals, a vault, and more. A devastating weapon of destruction has Robert scrambling to get ahead of the clues. With a 400 year old trail of symbols, Robert has try to outwit and outplay some very powerful and clever opponents. This made for quite a thrilling read!\n",

      "I read this novel the first time several years ago when it was hyped and piled up in every bookstore in Germany. Back then I loved it. But afterwards, every time I read a new novel by Dan Brown, I liked it but felt like something was missing. Now, after rereading 'Angels and Demons' I know that his following works weren't worse than this one. I simply did not notice the flaws in it when I read it the first time. The story is an exciting mixture of historical facts and science fiction, which moves along quickly and is great for a quick read. But as usual, such a style results in less complex characters - a good thing for people who are bored easily with too long descriptions, but in a series, I prefer main characters that are more detailed. Instead, you learn more about the killer than about the hero. This works well for this kind of thriller, but does not match my personal preference.\n",
      "On another note, for me it was more interesting to read it while/after having traveled to Rome. The descriptions in the novel are not bad, but it's easier to imagine everything knowing at least some of the places, simply because the architecture in Rome has a pretty distinct style and I guess most people imagine it differently just reading the description.\n",

      "Eens we in Rome zijn is de zoektocht naar de waarheid heel fijn om volgen, ware het niet dat door de titel van het Nederlandstalige boek er al één grote omwenteling weggeven wordt. Doordat het boek soms wat vooruitblikt pf op ineens een focus legt op iets wat onbelangrijk lijkt (maar dus later nog terugkomt) zag ik veel twists al aankomen. Het verassingseffect was weg. Misschien ligt dit aan mijn te goed geheugen als ik een boek lees, maar ik heb graag dat een auteur slimmer is dan ik en dat was hier niet het geval. De meest cliché kunstwerken (op één uitzondering na) van Bernini werden ook aangehaald (net als in ieder ander boek over Bernini en Rome), daar had Brown meer mee kunnen doen.\n",

Human nature being what it is, we like to have a story that explains the seeming chaos in our lives, and in historical events. Yet human nature being what it is, no one could reasonably expect any one person, never mind a group of people, keeping any sort of secret for that long, especially if there was some way for them to profit from it in their own self-interest. Life is unpredictable and chaotic by nature. Bad things happen randomly to good people, and vice versa.

      "My boy Tolstoy really wrote back in the 1800s about an incel getting married and a thot ruining her own life. Legend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although portions of this book were a real slog, I have to say I loved it overall. The characters are complex and unbelievably relevant to modern day relationships between men, women, and society in general. It seems the modern views of post-religiosity and unshackled romantic commitments have been prevalent for over 200 years and still unresolved. This book does a wonderful job musing on all of those points.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard this book referred to as \"the greatest novel of all time,\" and I can understand that comment because it is so all-encompassing. The aristocratic world of 1800s Russia really comes alive in this book. You have the crux of the drama through the romance... square... with Levin, Kitty, Vronsky, and Anna but you have quite a lot of time dedicated to adjacent day-to-day stuff. Things like Levin studying how to best achieve agriculture efficiency, Oblonsky navigating a nepotistic hiring structure, Karenin going to the capital to debate national politics, Varenka finding a place in society after a failed relationship, Dolly attending to home affairs through speaking to servants and family, and many other \"unimportant\" things that give the novel so much life. I feel like I've gained a real understanding of the time period.\n",
      "\n",
      "What seals the novel's appeal is how approachable it is. The language is simple — although the topics and discussions often are not. There is never an overly rosy description of a character, location, or thought. Everything is matter of fact. Even the book's many forays into philosophizing are couched in the context of how these ideas are relevant to an ordinary person (or at the very least express anxiety that the thoughts are not relevant to an ordinary person). The book is as good today as it was 200 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to qualify my views on this book it would be the two important points: 1) There were absolutely stretches of ~50 pages that I really hoped to be over. Levin out on a farm or Anna's latter sections stick out in my memory. 2) More importantly — I absolutely hated Anna's character. I guess that's the point? Tolstoy clearly disliked her as well, but it was really infuriating. Probably because her character felt very real. I am certain that person exists in real life. I also hope they meet the same fate. Maybe there could've been a way to depict it as more tragic, but idk.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that in mind, I really loved this book. I guess I have to read Tolstoy's other work now.\n",
      "3.75\n",
      "Il pregio dei romanzi autoconclusivi che possono vantare una grande mole di pagine è quello di riuscire a incarnare una storia. A seconda dell’abilità dell’autore, i personaggi, prima o poi, escono dalla loro bidimensionalità, si spingono oltre e assumono una propria composizione assoluta. In Anna Karenina, questo accade già alla conclusione della prima parte. Nelle rimanenti sette, Tolstoj trascina il lettore in una storia che procede lenta ma che è pregna di dettagli e riflessioni. È proprio l’introspezione dei personaggi l’elemento su cui l’autore maggiormente si concentra, e, se da una parte questo rende i personaggi persone in carne e ossa della cui inesistenza nella Russia di fine ‘800 vi rimarrà difficile convincervi, dall’altra Tolstoj usa alcuni di loro e la società per esternalizzare le sue riflessioni su un’infinità di argomenti.\n",
      "Dopo questo preambolo, di che cosa parla Anna Karenina? Di una donna che commette adulterio, giusto? Verissimo, ma è anche estremamente riduttivo. In questo romanzo, si alternano vari punti di vista ma, alla fin fine, sono quelli di Anna e del coprotagonista, Konstantin Dmitrič Levin, ad essere preponderanti. Sono esseri simili, accomunati dal fatto che la società e tutte le sue regole non scritte producono degli effetti su di loro, ma anche innegabilmente contrapposti.\n",
      "Anna, una giovane donna sposata, più di tutto gioiosa e in cui la vita batte con frenesia, sfida la società con ardore quando s’innamora e intraprende una relazione segreta con il conte Vrònskij. In principio, tenta di resistere, ma, dopo non molto, decide di seguire appunto il cuore, un sentimento genuino ma estremamente egoistico e che è quasi una reazione alla repressione collettiva, che la farà capitare su una strada tortuosa, fatta di passioni e maldicenze.\n",
      "Levin, a differenza di Anna, tenta di adattarsi alla società e alla vita stessa, trovandosi a riflettere a fondo su una miriade di sensazioni, emozioni e assiomi. È sicuramente il personaggio con il carattere più altalenante di tutti, tanto che in se stesso vige un continuo dibattito su come essere una persona migliore e su come essere felice, ma, anche quando gli sembrerà di aver ottenuto ciò che più desidera, seguendo un percorso alla fine impostato, metterà tutto in discussione, riprendendo le fila di una ponderazione senza fine.\n",
      "Tra di loro, svettano molti altri personaggi di cui Tolstoj tesse perfettamente le qualità e, soprattutto, i difetti che, se ci fermiamo un attimo a riflettere, derivano sempre e solo dalla collettività in cui vivono. Tutti loro sono influenzati da essa e dalla posizione che ricoprono al suo interno; quindi, li vedremo venire a patti con ciò che gli succederà o soffrire per la realtà delle loro condizioni.\n",
      "Un paragrafo a parte la merita la scrittura che mai come in questo libro racchiude un livello minuzioso di dettagli, e che è capace di comunicare pensieri, addirittura esistenziali, talmente profondi e riconoscibili da lasciare senza fiato. Sono tutti ragionamenti che credo in molti si ritrovino a fare prima o poi, ma, sebbene nella nostra mente risultino essere astratti qualche volta, in Anna Karenina sono proprio davanti ai nostri occhi, sotto forma di inchiostro; ogni frase collegata alla successiva con una maestria assoluta. Sono proprio questi i passaggi per cui questo romanzo dovrebbe essere letto da chiunque. Non è sicuramente una lettura semplice ma vi assicuro che il raggiungimento di questi momenti merita le 1065 pagine di cui è composta; e sono anche dell’opinione che, una volta terminata, ognuno si accorgerà che il proprio bagaglio personale si è arricchito con una nuova e più ampia consapevolezza.\n",

      "Overall I liked this book... but it was far too long. I think going into it I expected something amazing from this book and perhaps some big revelation at the end that would have been building throughout the 800 pages... but no.\n",
      "This doesn't mean it wasn't good. Some parts were especially good and really kept my attention and I wanted to know what came next. But other parts were completely uninteresting to me, perhaps because I didn't live in Russia in the 1800s. I was also disappointed in the end, Anna was not as strong of a character as I hoped she would be.\n",
      "I feel like I'm dissing on this book... which is because I ended it on a fairly sour note because I wasn't impressed by the end. Overall though I liked it quite a bit and am glad that I read this classic.\n",

      "Anna Kariênina foi um desafio para mim, mas também uma leitura muito prazerosa. Demorei mais de um ano para ler, em capítulos diários, em pequenas doses onde pude sugar todo o mel dessa obra-prima.\n",
      "O livro é um emaranhado de personagens, dezenas deles, onde se entrelaçam e formam um enredo belíssimo. Apesar de ser um livro com um grande número de personagens, os principais são Anna Kariênina, Liévin, Vrónski e Kitty.\n",
      "Anna Kariênina, linda e casada se envolve com Vronski. Esta escolha trará-lhe grandes consequências: distanciamento de seu filho, abandono da sociedade, desprezo. Anna Kariênina também era muito ciumenta, era obcecada por Vronski, essa obsessão a fará ver coisas inexistentes e irá desgastar muito seu casamento, trazendo tristezas e Morte para o casal.\n",
      "Lievin, é um personagem que me agrada muito, ele é sincero e firme em seus pensamentos. Ele parece não se encaixar na sociedade que vive. Lievin, depois de uma decepção inicial em relação a Kitty (Kitty tinha anteriormente escolhido Vronski a ele) case se com ela e com muitas dificuldades conseguem se estabilizar e vivem uma vida feliz.\n",
      "Kitty, também muito bela, sofreu com algumas escolhas que fez em sua vida, uma delas foi ter escolhido Vronski ao invés de Lievin para se relacionar. Kitty não conseguiu ter um relacionamento com Vronski, e também se sentia muito mal em relação a lievin por não o ter escolhido. Ela fica muito doente, vai para o exterior se cura, e na volta casa se com Lievin.\n",
      "Vronski era um homem rico, orgulhoso, que era muito interessado em Kitty, até pôr os olhos na bela Anna Kariênina, que o enfeitiçou. Foi contra tudo e contra todos, principalmente contra sua mãe, que não gostava de Anna Kariênina e era totalmente contra esse relacionamento. Lievin enfrentou muitas dificuldades: Anna Kariênina era casada com um alto funcionário, Aleksiei Aleksándrovitch, que não concedeu o divórcio a ela, fazendo com que Anna ficasse longe do seu filho e totalmente isolada. Juntando tudo isso mais a obsessão de Anna por ele, fez com que sua vida e seu relacionamento se tornasse insustentável.\n",
      "Como podem ver os personagens se entrelaçam, numa teia gigante.\n",

      "Welcome to 19th-century Russian society filled with gossip, scandals, infidelity, romance, and tragedy. While I am not new to classics, Anna Karenina is one of the most timeless, nuanced, and enchanting stories I've ever read. Tolstoy presents 3 couples with the most complex depth to their personalities that make them unique and vibrant to the story. His brilliance and talent in writing are seen in how he was able to interweave all these characters' stories with one another while also adding points for both a philosophical and sociological analysis. His prose is simply masterful as he has transported me into such a tumultuous world and story that made me so attached to the point I didn't even want it to end anymore.\n",
      "\n",

Instead of character development, we see Anna's descent into madness and her downfall as she pays the price of her decisions and infidelity. However, while Anna may be annoying throughout the eight parts of the book because of her anxiety and insecurity, she is one of the most complex characters in literature because you see how her extravagant life completely shatters due to what she has given up in order to live the life she believed she wanted. You will find yourself questioning whether or not she is deserving of empathy because you see how all she wanted was simply to love and to be loved in whatever way she wanted.

      "Uno de los grandes clásicos intimidantes. Claramente es una crítica a la sociedad, que se preocupa solo por aparentar, que era la sociedad en la que el autor escribió esta obra y era en la que él estaba inmerso y demuestra tener conocimiento del tema. Es un poco difícil de seguir al comienzo, porque tiene muchos personajes y tramas, y es difícil seguir como es que están conectadas unas con otras. Hay que tomarlo con calma. Lo que me llama la atención, es que si bien la novela tiene su nombre en el título, hay partes donde es debatible si Anna es la protagonista de la historia. Es interesante, aunque no la ame. Lo valioso que me quedo, es que tiene una valiosa lección sobre qué pasa cuando el significado de nuestra vida, pasa solo por estar en una relación o solo por tener o sentir amor de pareja, y que vacía y desesperada es la vida, cuando esto es así. Igual tengo un problema con cómo son retratadas las mujeres en esta obra, especialmente Anna, pero no solo ella. Y a todos los personajes masculinos me dan ganas de golpearlos, cuando expresan su visión sobre los personajes femeninos. Lo peor es que incluso en el mundo actual, hay hombres que tienen esa misma visión. No estoy diciendo que este mal escrita, lo que tengo es un problema con la visión que presenta. Puede ser un tema generacional, no lo se, pero esto es lo que me paso con esta obra. Simplemente me niego a justificar los problemas de la obra con la excusa de la época.\n",

      "Phewf, this was a giant of a book that I (surprisingly) thoroughly enjoyed. The problems I had with this book was the many chapters spent on boring matters mostly relating to Levin's point of view. There were many scenes dedicated to describing agriculture, hunting, Karenin's work and Vronsky's art that I couldn't care less for. The discussions on politics for a while could be interesting but they went on for so long and they were about education and women's equality that were outdated views that my modern brain didn't even want to consider.\n",
      "The major negative I had for this book was the insecurity the characters had in their reactions especially Vronksy/Anna and Kitty/Levin. It was so repetitive and seemed to dim the love the characters had for each other I was left confused as to why Tolstoy wanted them together in the first place. I also think that if Anna and Kitty were written by a female these breakdowns over jealousy for a partner wouldn't be so pathetic and demeaning to their complex characters.\n",
      "It's known that Levin is Tolstoy's inner thoughts but I wish Tolstoy was selfless enough not to make him such a prevalent character. Anna was what made the novel so intriguing and kept me wanting more. It was also anticlimactic to have another part after Anna's death about Levin finding God and I didn't care for it.\n",

      "In saying all that, I really, really enjoyed the book which is evident in me completing it in less than a week. I absolutely loved the internal conflict within Anna and how she went from inspiring and beloved to conniving and wracked with jealousy. What I took from her story is you yourself can be a big part in your own downfall. I was also very sympathetic towards her as she was banished from society whilst Vronsky could still flourish. I'm glad Tolstoy highlighted this injustice.\n",

We broke the story up into five Zoom chats based on the parts of the book, and it was a great way to work our way through the story.

It is a story rich in detail and depth, with characters that I enjoyed reading about, even if I didn't always like them very much. This is a book that I will hold on to to read again sometime in the future. There is so much that I likely missed the first time through. For anyone who feels that this book isn't accessible to them, please give it a shot. I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition with the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky and the writing is so good.

But what I find even more interesting is how I am beginning to realize that there is a mindset that inhabits people who do not live in what is traditionally known as Western Civilization, which is foreign and strange to us.

Aleksei allows Anna to openly pursue an affair with Vronsky, even under his own roof, so long as she minimizes the gossip her actions will cause.

It was originally written as a serial, so certainly Tolstoy was encouraged to pad the story and draw it out as much as possible.

I think of promotions I strived for, that left me feeling no more fulfilled than before. Of goals accomplished, hurdles overcome.

E o que dizer de um autor que escreve de uma forma tão bonita e tão próxima, que parece que estava ao meu lado, diante de uma lareira, a contar-me uma história? Tolstói consegue falar de assuntos sérios e colocar-nos a reflectir, ao mesmo tempo que cria personagens completas e as coloca num enredo maravilhoso. E neste livro encontrei Levine, que é só uma das minhas personagens preferidas da literatura, revi-me inúmeras vezes nele e torci por ele desde o começo. Acho que nada mais brilhante foi colocado na ficção. Quanto a Ana, afinal ela dá nome ao livro (ainda não entendi porquê), achei-a chata, depois egoísta, depois tive pena dela, depois irritou-me e depois apeteceu-me correr para dentro do livro para a impedir de fazer o que fez e de lhe dar uns quantos abanões. Em suma, gostei dela no todo, mas foi Levine que me conquistou (ele e algumas personagens que estão directamente relacionadas com ele). Mas e o final deste livro? Coisa mais bonita alguma vez foi escrita? E o mais engraçado é que a primeira e a última frase fazem todo o sentido e interligam-se genialmente com toda a história.

With Anna killing herself at the end of part seven (her final second thoughts had me shaking with distress for her), when nobody other than Vronsky seemed to be truly mourning or changed because of the events had me a little shocked until I realised it may have been an intentional show of just how far she had been pushed away from society that despite her downfall and demise, it was all worth next to nothing in the end as she had been so secluded by the end that hardly anyone was affected and even she knew, right before her time was up, that she was making a mistake.

      "I think the only real weaknesses in Anna Karenina come from it being serialised. It's possibly *slightly* too long. At times it really did feel a bit like reading weekly instalments of Kostya Levin's Spiritual Adventures and Social Anxiety. And some interesting plot hooks are never picked up. This serialised nature makes for a pleasant, meandering read, but came at the expense of a more coherent plot structure with satisfying conclusions. When such a major plot event happens (spoilers! yes, for a 140 yr old book) within 100pgs of the end of this 1000 page story, and we get only the slightest of insights into the effect that it has on characters (a comment or two, and no further chapters from the narrative POV of affected characters), it feels unsatisfying (especially as AK is the only female character afforded a comparable narrative voice in this story to the male characters)... but this is also, in part, the point. The anticlimactic reaction of the society set who tells this story to what should be such a pivotal event reveals its utter pointlessness. This is its real tragedy. It perfectly encapsulates the character in question's descent into social insignificance. The tantalisingly brief insight we get into Vronsky's resulting trauma is frustrating to the reader, but necessary. What more can we ask? Tolstoy leaves Vronsky's grief alone, to be forgotten. The world moves on. There is good work to be done...\n",

      "No es sencillo hacer una sinópsis de la novela; si bien el personaje de Anna Karenina es uno de los personajes principales, no diría que juega un papel crucial en la historia; tal vez la razón por la cual es el título del libro es por el dramático final que tiene ese personaje en particular. La trama está compuesta por los nexos e historias de amor y desamor entre distintas familias de la aristocracia rusa.

He’s overwhelmed with emotion and forgives her and they embrace and Vronsky embarrassed and weak looks away but I believe karenin draws him and together they hold Anna and help give her the strength to survive her troubled birth. Its like so full of Grace and mercy and recognition of each other’s humanity i love it. BUT it happens in the middle of the book! so of course it cant last! and Tolsyoy is so brilliant to show that this, though beautiful, is just a moment, and Karenin’s renewed love is actually not the love that Anna wants! he begins doting on her too much and like saying how everything will be just the way it was etc etc and its like ultimately, what she was after was the ability to make her own choices, and this new affection he shows towards her is almost condescending! hes not letting her be herself, hes saying hurray I saved you and I forgive you and I’ll take care of you and basically you’ll never have to do anything and its like my guy that is just not it.

      "this was just incredible. it’s hard to believe that something written so long ago can still be so relevant. i think that if this took place in present day, many of the conflicts would’ve been resolved. of course not all of them, but certainly some. i think that a lot of the characters’ wants are constrained by the time period. i realize that i’m so luck to live in a society where dating/breaking up and marriage/divorce is normalized. i genuinely feel like if anna hadn’t married karenin so young or without knowing him super well, she wouldn’t have felt so lonely and unsatisfied. and even if she still had married him and if she could’ve easily divorced him (without all of the stigma) for vronsky, they wouldn’t have had all of the animosity and blame that plagued their relationship. they would’ve been able to have a healthier relationship and everything wouldn’t have ended in the way that it did. anna’s suicide was actually really surprising to me, but at the same time, it made sense. she felt completely trapped in her situation with vronsky once again, yet she blamed for everything that happened. her extreme jealousy and her constant highs and lows led her to further blame him for their situation. he was getting exhausted with the complexity and difficulties in their relationship, which caused him to become colder. she felt no way out, but she also wanted to get “revenge” or show vronsky. i do think that killing herself the same way someone died one of the first times they met was just brilliant. almost as a reminder of what their relationship felt like in the beginning, versus what it felt like in the end. i also think it was really interesting how after she was dead, there really wasn’t much mention of her death. it didn’t really go much into vronsky’s grieving or anyone else’s. in some way, it made it feel like he was almost irrelevant to the story without her. it was also interesting how the other characters didn’t even discuss it much. i mean sure, her whole situation was taboo, but i would’ve thought there’d have been more. i think it shows almost that their whole relationship and later tragedy was for nothing. the guilt and blame ended up ruining both their relationship and who they were. \n",

      "Заедничката точка на Ана и Вронски е токму меѓу линијата на среќните и несреќните семејства. Со несигурност стојат во една иста положба, знаејќи дека ако не преземат нешто ќе изгубат се. Заглавени во магла, тие се стремат кон бистрата виделина. А, нивното пристигнување таму, односно во реалноста, ја ослепува Ана со наивност и нагло избувнување за најситните работи. Тогаш ни е јасно дека таа се откажа од своето семејство само за да одржи една кратка искра која ја споделуваше со Вронски. Сласта ја снема, исто како и искреноста, а празните ветувања пристигнаа.\n",
      "Бракот меѓу Доли и Облонски се состоеше од потонета љубов која тој самиот не можеше да ја спаси. А пак таа не ни се трудеше. Кога човек губи доверба во друг, ја губи и почитта. Откако Доли чу за неговото неверство таа ја прифати својата судбина – да остане во брак без љубов. За неа беше сосема прифатливо да се крие позади стаклена рамка пред општеството. Исправена со висок став и кисела насмевка, додека нејзините деца беа покрај неа. И секако, нејзиниот маж покрај нејзината снага.\n",
      "Љубовта меѓу Кити и Левин од почеток беше еднострана. Левин ја гледаше неа како суштество што е над се земно, а се гледаше себеси како приземно суштество што не е достоен за неа. Меѓутоа, одбивањето на бракот од страна на Кити му овозможи да ги преиспита своите вредности. А, една од тие вредности беше семејството.\n",
      "Алексеј Каренин, чесниот морален човек, реши да се соочи со своите проблеми на интересен начин. Откако ја чу вистината за врската меѓу жена му и Вронски, реши да го зачува својот брак. Значи, иако тој знаел дека жена му ја предала својата љубов на друг човек, поважно му било да го задржи својот статус. Самиот статус кој му помага во својата кариера и пред масата, но не позади заклучените врати. Токму клучевите за овие врати ни ги дава Толстој, предупредувајќи не за нив уште од самиот почеток.\n",
      "Позади сите раскошни балови и ласкања се криеше реалноста на сите овие семејства. Никаков раскош не би можел да ги прикрие тајните кои ги чуваа во својите јатаци.\n",

      "Where has Anna Karenina been my entire life? For years I had written it off as another story of flirtation, adultery, and the climactic ruin of a heroine in disastrous love. Now I see that Tolstoy encompasses many themes both epic and also everyday in human life: love, family, hypocrisy, God, faith, society, politics. Some of the extensive passages of Russian politics were a bit weighty for my taste, as well as over-abundant descriptions of certain affairs, but as a whole, this remarkable novel has left its impression. I shall be thinking about these characters, as tangible as the people in my life, for time after time.\n",

This book scratched itches in my brain that have, no matter what, always been unanswered. Until now. And the ending? I'm not quite sure if my heart clenches at the thought of it's torrential tragedy OR if it simply clenches at the thought of leaving behind this humane habitat of realness that Tolstoy created with all its pain and passion. Either way, let it be sure—someday I shall return to it.\n",

Empecé amando a Anna y terminé sintiendo compasión por ella, a pesar de ser el personaje central la historia no recae sobre ella en ningún momento, es más bien como una pieza clave para que el desarrollo llegue a donde debe y todo encaje, también para entender la historia de los otros; la novela está llena de sentimentalismo, debate y reflexión sobre las limitantes sociales, personales, amorosas y sexuales de las mujeres en aquellos tiempos pero también hace gran alusión a la moral, al bien y mal social, a la relación con Dios, al trabajo obrero, a la educación, a la delgada línea que marca lo que es correcto e incorrecto, es una constante crítica a la necesidad de decidir entre ceder a los placeres aceptables o seguir los instintos y la propia felicidad y como esto es bien reconocido para unos y sentenciado para otros…\n",

      "The low ish rating is because I just don’t see myself ever recommending it. It was good but what was good about it wasn’t really worth the rest? Or the length maybe. My favorite parts were maybe midway when Lenin and Kittt get together. The way the author describes their love is beautiful. And Karenin’s forgiveness had me sobbing. Really moving. But the rest of the book was very just okay. I think the last 1/3 reads like a completely different novel. I’m not sure I ever really believed Anna’s despair, and so her death didn’t quite feel right. I think how Tolstoy thrust the reader back into dreary insignificant life immediately after was a clever way to have the reader experience of grief. I thought the juxtaposition of Anna’s suicide with Lenin’s finding faith was a little too obvious? It didn’t feel as moving as I think Tolstoy wanted it to. Hate and death and reason versus love and faith and life. We get it? But certainly some moments I resonated with and enjoyed. Maybe that’s the point though. Not all of life is moving. But I remember even in the first half, there was so much Tolstoy skipped over! He breezed through Anna and Vronsky’s affair. Just noting the first time they slept together, for example. Those are moments I would have wanted to feel with the charecters! Anyway. Good but not great.\n",

      "Asi como en Guerra y Paz Tolstoi hace un contraste entre el la actividad en el campo de batalla y el ocio en de las clases aristocraticas que se quedan en Rusia, en este libro para mi se hace un interesante contraste entre llevar una vida guida por la pasión y el amor (reflejado en el arco argumental de Anna Karenina) y el llevar una vida guiada por la razón y la lógica (Lievin), con consecuencias mayoritariamente negativas para ambos personajes.\n",

      "Si bien las consecuencias para Anna terminan siendo nefastas, Lievin también iba mal a su propia forma, logrando salvarse solo al final cuando se decide por seguir el camino de la fé. No me molesta per se que sea la fé lo que lo salve, sino el hecho de que Tolstoi use solo las 40 páginas finales para abordar esa alternativa y sin llegar a profundizar suficiente en ello, habiendo usado mas de 800 páginas para debatir explorar los otros puntos (con solo algunas alusiones previas al tema religioso). Me queda con ello una cierta sensación de Deux ex machina que salva al protagonista.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sin embargo, mas allá de un final que no me dejó 100% conforme, no le resto casi por ello mérito a una de las mejores novelas que he leído en años. Tolstoi, manteniendo la potencia descriptiva que ya había mostrado en Guerra y Paz, logra adicionalmente incluir y explorar aspectos emocionales de los personajes, llegando a un punto culmine en el personaje de Anna Karenina hacia el final del libro, pero también apreciable a través la novela entera y en multiples personajes y arcos argumentales.\n",

You are privy to dozens of characters thoughts, constantly switching back and forth, sometimes within the same paragraph. It may sound a bit confusing, it isn’t, the way it’s done works to perfection. One moment you are in the head of Anna, analyzing every word and gesture in the room, then you are in the head of Vronsky, doing similar analysis and coming to similar and/or contrary conclusions about what just happened. Misunderstandings abound, such is life. That is what Tolstoy does best, he shows us a bit of life.\n",

So many books, especially current ones, is all about the destination. Getting from point A to point B. While there is certainly nothing wrong with that, it just took myself a bit of adjusting to get used to the idea of a novel that didn't have that as the focus. This novel was purely about the journey. Following the lives of all these people and getting to know them.\n",

      "Now, this book could have easily been a Point A to point B book, it would have been a lot shorter, and it still would have been interesting. However, the strength in this lies with everything else. This book, the author I think did an amazing job in not only creating real people, but also getting under the hood and into the minds of these people. You know what they're thinking, why they're thinking it, their emotions, the internal struggles, all of that. You see yourself in them in how they struggle with their emotions and feelings of just being human. Time and again you see someone analyzing and interpreting the actions of others and in turn making their own judgements. You hear them saying to themselves that they shouldn't be having these thoughts and emotions, that its silly and unjustified but they're going to feel that way anyway because they can't help it and because they're human.\n",

It goes beyond the \"happily ever after\" and beyond the \"tragedy\". It keeps going, things keep moving along. It shows that life is a never ending journey.

Even if you forgot about the love, death, and deception, you could toss these characters into a run-of-the-mill curling bonspiel, and Tolstoy would still probably be able to squeeze a couple hundred interesting pages out of the ensuing situation. For a white dude writing like 140 years ago, Tolstoy writes surprisingly good female characters. They're obviously not perfect, but they're far better than the slabs of stone that you'll find in most books written by dudes even 70 years ago.\n",

      "Overall, I'm glad I read it, and I enjoyed it a lot, but it's no Dostoevsky (e.g., Brothers Karamazov). Anna Karenina is a different book than Brothers K—less overtly philosophical and psychological. You learn a lot more about characters in Anna Karenina through their interactions with others, whereas Dostoevsky just plants you smack dab in the middle of their heads. I'm sure upon closer inspection this has just as much to say as Brothers Karamazov, but I like Dostoevsky better because he says to hell with subtlety and instead opts to bludgeon you to death with the philosophy.\n",

Was she correct to do as she did, I realize I'm no one to judge that. She was consumed with love, longing, and a passion so strong that it burned her and everyone around her. And that was her downfall too. She just couldn't settle for an ordinary love. She wanted Vronsky and wanted all of him. She wanted all his love, his fire, his time, his attention on her at all times and that he couldn't give.

Her pride became her downfall. Her slip from sanity to insanity was marvelously done. How quickly her emotions dipped and ebbed- exhausting and excellent. Tolstoy beautifully portrays the human experience. And I was surprised to find that I agreed with his interpretations of the women in the novel.

I think Kitty was probably my favorite character. Maybe because she was the most stable and caused me the least amount of emotional toil?

From the first chapter I had this odd fondness for Stepan and Dolly, and I soon had this same sentimental feeling towards all of the main players.

I think the first quarter of the book is brilliant, the rest of the book is solidly great until the ending with the final Anna sequence, which was a bit painful to read. Part 8 (the final 10% of the book) can be described in a single word -perfunctory. If books were edited back then like they are now, this book I think can rightly be considered a masterpiece, but I'm not sure how critics can ignore how needlessly bloated this book is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criticism out of the way, I'll discuss why I think the book is good. Despite the book's title, Anna Karenina is a story about an extended Russian family that focus on three main couples. The story begins when Stepan Arkadyich's wife Dolly discovers he is having an affair with his governess. She is completely distraught and Stepan is at a loss on how to reconcile with his wife. He invites his sister Anna, who is married to Alexei Alexandrovich and imperial government official, to meet with his wife.\n",

      "\n",
      "After Anna's visit with Dolly, she happens to encounter the same Alexei Vronsky after a horrific train accident. This fateful introduction leads to these two falling in love and the main story of the novel focuses on the fallout of this illicit affair, which her husband is fully aware of, but refuses to grant her a divorce and hence her freedom. Kitty is also humiliated because she felt that Vronsky was in love with her, but then ditches her after seeing Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book has one of the most famous opening lines \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" The core of this story is the examination of married life among the nobility in late 19th century Russia. The contrast between the relative ease Stepan is forgiven by his wife versus the hell and powerlessness and hopelessness Anna feels by a husband she detests. Anna's husband has all the power. She won't be able to see her son, he has all the money, the influence, and the prestige. She is a ruined woman, but Stepan suffers very little of consequence for his infidelity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Anna is the one who had the affair. I often found it hard to sympathize with her because she is the guilty party who knows the social norms of Russia, as unfair as they are. Unfortunately, I grew to like her less and less throughout the book and the final sequence leading to the climax was predictable but also cringeworthy to read. I understand why she feels so powerless and distraught, but I didn't understand her feelings toward her lover, Vronsky, which seemed completely irrational.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also didn't understand why Anna and Vronksy loved each other. You just kind of have to accept Anna is willing to throw away her life for this man. This is not a love affair you root for or understand the trouble and pain. Anna is also rather unlikeable for not caring about her daughter while at the same time showering us with her doom and gloom about not being able to see her beloved son. I found this to be rather distasteful.\n",

      "Beyond examination of these three main couples, the author uses the text to discuss political philosophy, slavic pan-nationalism, farming techniques, and economics. There is also a lot of discussion of faith, both fervent belief and debilitating doubt. There was A LOT Tolstoy wanted to get off his chest and tell the Russian world what he thinks, regardless of how well it fits into the narrative. Since this book was written in a far different time, I still found these passages to be interesting from a historical context. I didn't mind it, but if I'm being critical, a lot of it was unnecessary for this novel. And the final part of the book barely mentions Anna and I'm not sure what the point was. I think it's meant to tie a thematic bow to the end of the book, but I felt like a  couple chapters beyond the end of Part 7 would have been a good time to finish the story.\n",

Despite the fact that I really did enjoy the first few chapters, I would always inevitably get bored with the length and wordiness and thus would stop reading after Part I. But this summer, I rediscovered my copy of the novel and decided that I would actually finish Anna Karenina. It took me a month and four days, but I did it! *victory lap*\n",
      "Anna Karenina follows several different storylines, but the major plotlines have to do with Anna Karenina, the novel’s namesake, and Constatine Levin. Basically, everyone has a really long and confusing Russian name that is impossible to remember, and they all have affairs or are worrying about their husband/wife/friend/neighbor having affairs. But deeper than that, Anna Karenina is a story about passion, societal expectations, and acceptance. I honestly am at a loss for words on how else I can describe this magnificent 954 pages of literature.\n",
      "The characters in this story are impeccably depicted throughout the entirety of the novel. My favorite character would have to be Levin. This co-protagonist is not your average Prince Charming. He’s awkward, unfazed by the glamour of the luxurious life, and questioning love and his faith. He doesn’t fit into the standard roles in Russian society, and instead searchingly paves his own path. While he is awkward in many respects, Levin is certainly kind-hearted and generous. Throughout the novel, readers watch the ever-endearing character experience true love, tumultuous childbirth, and the discovery of true happiness.\n",
      "I also learned a lot about Russia in the 19th century. Despite my sophomore year in high school stint with AP European History, I’m genuinely pretty clueless when it comes to the history of Russia. I was absolutely enthralled with the enormous amount of social progress that was taking place during the time period of the novel. Specifically, of course, I was very fascinated with the theme of women’s rights laced throughout the pages. I appreciated watching Kitty’s mother have difficulty with allowing her to choose her own husband, needing to adjust to the more modern way of love in society. It was also interesting to watch the potential process of divorce occur- how difficult it was to get a divorce, with a woman having no chance of being able to successfully file for divorce.\n",
      "While I really did enjoy the story, I seemed to have difficulty with the length of the novel. Tolstoy is brilliant and every single word was a part of the masterpiece that is Anna Karenina, but I was frustrated knowing that he could have written the exact same story in about half the words. Upon researching the format of the book a little more, I found that Tolstoy published the novel in installments over a period of four years. Once I found this out, I definitely appreciated the length a lot more than I had previously.\n",
      "I could rant and rant about my personal pros and cons of Anna Karenina, but I attempted to summarize my feelings in a somewhat concise fashion. If you’ve been debating whether or not to tackle the long, long novel, I recommend taking the plunge and going for it. While slow at some points, this book does truly deserve all of the praise it has been given throughout the course of history. I’m giving it 4.5 stars. Perhaps if I revisit the novel in the future, my rating will change. I’ll let you know!\n",

      "\n",
      "In general, the book seems very modern and ahead of its time (although to be honest I know basically nothing about 19th centuray Russia) but a lot of the themes are still valid today. For example how Anna is viewed as a loose woman and Vronsky is the great stud. And how a woman is supposed to be pious and happy sitting at home with the kids while the men go out and have fun. Also how catty all the women are to each other. But I know that's what you get reading classics and at least some things improved in the last 150 years.\n",

Anna Karenina on yllättävän helppolukuinen, sen teemat sopivat yllättävän hyvin nykypäivään ja sen henkilöhahmot ovat yllättävän moniulotteisia, lähestulkoon eläviä. Kirja piti sisällään upeita kohtauksia jotka tulen muistamaan vielä pitkään ja olen todella iloinen, että olen saanut lukea ne. Haluaisin suositella tätä klassikkoa ihan jokaiselle, mutta valitettavasti aika on tehnyt tehtävänsä, ja moni nykylukija (minä mukaan lukien) on tottunut hyvin editoituihin kirjoihin joissa ei ole turhaa välissä. Tarina on epätasapainossa ja Anna Kareninan sijaan Lev saa paljon tilaa omille pohdinnoilleen. Pidin kovasti tunteellisesta ja sympaattisesta Levistä, mutta liika on liikaa. Annalle sen sijaan olisi voitu antaa enemmän tilaa. Painotan arvioinneissani omaa lukukokemustani, ja kyseessä on tietenkin upea klassikko, joka kuvastaa omaa aikaansa.

      "Tolstoy deftly tackles the topics of faith and religion, lust, marriage, love, classism, women's rights, urban and agrarian lifestyles, economics, philosophy--it's all here. There isn't a dull moment. And woven throughout it all is the compelling story of Anna herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is undeniable truth in Tolstoy's work, and it shines through in such a way that one doesn't feel as though Tolstoy's opinions are being force-fed. A brilliant novel.\n",
      "5.0\n",
      "It's hard to say something about a book that has been read, enjoyed and discussed by so many people before. This one took me a while but it contains a bit of everything.\n",
      "At first it seemed quite charming and I looked the modern, lively style of the prose (although I can't say how much of the 'modern' aspect comes from the translation)\n",
      "The book is surprisingly honest about some subjects such as birth control, and then coy about others (we are told a child misbehaved but the narrative goes to pains to avoid telling the reader exactly what they did)\n",
      "The scope of the book covers all subjects and it's both an asset and a failure. The characters discussions and musings on politics, philosophy and agriculture (not to mention jam making) paint a vivid picture of Russia at the time, but it makes the narrative drag and often feels like it could have been a separate essay.\n",
      "The characters are all incredibly well depicted, and I don't know if it's my modern view point or if it's meant for comedic or tragic purposes at some points, but often it seems that a great fuss is being made over nothing. The overreactions can be frustrating, but by the very end some of them actually become convincing as a sort of tragic madness.\n",
      "3.75\n",
      "I am little embarrassed at how long this took me. With that in mind, I never had to go back and read what I read last time. The story stuck with me all year. I was able to read other books in the midst of it and still understand and stay in touch with the story. I enjoyed it a lot. I am glad that I have finally read it and look forward to reading some critiques and essays about it.\n",
      "3.5\n",
      "Incredible. This one really made me realise how much I have missed classics.\n"

I do wish he included a bit more written details from the story, but his illustrations tell a great deal — some of which are very graphic. I found the mostly monochromatic illustrations to be an interesting choice and notice how the primary color changes by scenes and depending on the mood of the action. The monochromatic illustrations style also looks to be less distracting from the text than if there were more colorful pictures. The way Hinds tells the story is seems very easy to understand for a reader unfamiliar with the original tale and served to easily call back the epic for me.\n",

I’ve compared a few passages here with translations elsewhere, and even though hers is much easier to understand (again, for a plebeian like me), it does not sacrifice the rhythms and lyricism of the original. In fact, some of the passages read so good that they even feel good on the tongue. I found myself reciting the poem alone in bed because of how tactile the words felt. Do modern words like ‘bro’, ‘f**k’, ‘hash tag’ and ‘MIA’ work all the time? Not really. In fact, they sometimes take me out of the moment, but they are few are far in between. If there ever was a gateway drug to the world of ancient epic poems, this is most definitely it.\n",

      "I have a lot of scattered thoughts but let's firstly start with the translation itself. Heaney does an absolutely brilliant job at making Beowulf accessible to someone who has actually never read this old english poem, like myself, before. It's very easy to comprehend and it's language is very modern. So I will say first that if you are like me and have never read beowulf before this translation is definitely for you. However, that being said... Heaney is very much a poet and not a historian so there are absolutely no notes in this translation. Which, in my opinion is a huge mistake. To give an example of what I mean, if I had not previously read things such as the Prose and Poetic eddas or even some of the old norse sagas things such things as \"ring giver\" or \"ring bearer\" (which just means king basically) would have absolutely confused me. So, for someone who is completely new entirely to Germanic style poetry this could definitely be a problem. The illustrations in the book this guy brought me absolute delight! I loved seeing some of the old Scandinavian art work, weapons, and hall recreations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the poem itself. All in all I found the story boring and the author (who you could definitely tell was closely tied with the later english Christian church) was biased. It was hard for me to grasp why someone who very clearly wants to express his ideals about God on to an ancient Scandinavian pagan hero. Was this author the original poems author? Or did he rewrite it to put his ideals of God into the story. I honestly cannot tell. I can usually ignore things like this such as Snorri Sturluson (an Icelandic poet and historian), who is entirely responsible for our understanding of the Germanic gods of mythology, who himself inserted God into his own interpretation of things but not to such a degree that it took away from pagan sources. I don't know...I'm not a historian nor a scholar so I'm sure I'm missing something but that's just my thoughts and feelings on things.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all of that said, the actual fights of Grendal, his mother and the dragon were actually incredibly epic and the only thing that kept me truely engaged to the story. I could definitely see how audiences who heard this story way back would be amazed. I mean, a noble hero fighting monsters and witches and getting treasure and glory! What's not to love about that?

There’s a lot that is familiar in the story Beowulf tells and Headley does a great job of showing that.

      "The execution really didn’t work for me, though. Interestingly, Headley seems much more fluent in the stilted, archaic phrasing you expect of a “typical” translation of Beowulf than she does with the contemporary language. This could have worked if she had woven contemporary terms and syntax into the poem throughout. Instead, what we get is an alternation between the two languages, a translation that is mostly conventional with a couplet here and there in contemporary slang, which just felt super jarring. Almost every instance of contemporary slang feels like a break from the poem, a break in the fourth wall, a wink at the reader. It just feels forced. A shift in register is also part of the issue for me: The majority of the poem is in what we read to be a formal language (whether it ought to be or not, that perception matters, as Headley observes in her intro). But the modern phrases are more than just modern; they’re the slang of very online bros, the most informal language we’ve got. There are also literal direct anachronistic references. I don’t see any rationale for “hashtag: blessed” making its way into this story except as a gimmick. On one hand, I’m glad that a new translation of Beowulf has become a subject of popular conversation. On the other hand, I feel like we could have done so without something that\n",

      "Though I had previously never read the story, Beowulf is pretty common in high school and college courses for its importance to the English canon (it’s the oldest piece of literature written originally in English). The translation you’ve read if you’re in that camp was likely either JRR Tolkien—it was among his favorite tales—or Seamus Heaney. (I read Heaney before reading Headley; it’s a pretty quick story to read.) Those two admit to taking the text very seriously and bringing a masculine and kingly tone to their work.\n",

      "\n",
      "The real strength of Headley’s Beowulf is the long introduction that describers her reasoning for taking on the ur-text of English and her methodology for the language she chose. Whereas Tolkien and Heaney assumed a rather proper stance, Headley took the approach that this was more akin to the type of story being told by the guy at the bar who’s already had a few.\n",

      "The story itself: I didn’t love Beowulf as a protagonist. It’s an action story, for sure, but without much character growth or movement. The first battle is exciting, thrilling, and novel; the second battle is still enticing enough to turn the pages; by the third battle, it seems a little repetitive. Beowulf starts as a great hero, ends as a great hero, and there’s just not much of a character arc.\n",

Heaney brings an understanding of orality to his writing which was a wonderful and continual reminder to me as I read that the sole manuscript which survives to us (and which does not claim the title Beowulf for this tale) was but one iteration of an epic that no doubt twisted and changed depending on who recited it and when. I've seen some reviewers complain that this translation is not absolutely faithful to the Old English. While I do have some sympathies for that viewpoint, when it comes to a text like this I am more of a mind to view Heaney as but the latest generation of a scop, sitting down to tell us the tale as he remembers it—as it matters to him.\n",

Busy only with slaying monsters and brawling with the other warriors, it is also one of the most famous examples of Old English verse (although arguably not the finest).\n",

      "As a translator, you have to make a couple of decisions, especially when translating poetry. And of course translating Old English verse is even more difficult, given its structure. OE poetry consists of two half-lines and uses head-rhyme (also referred to as alliteration*) and not end-rhyme.\n",
      "Hwæt! We Gar-Dena in gear-dagum\n",

      "hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon! (ll. 1-3)\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the opening lines to Beowulf. I have emphasised which words are stressed through metre and head-rhyme. Notice the break (caesura) in the sentence which, as you can see from the manuscript page, is not found in the manuscript. They have been added by modern editors to differentiate between the a-line (first half) and the b-line (latter half). Both stressed words in the a-line may rhyme (head-rhyme) with the first stressed word in the b-line. Therefore, it is \"Hwæt! We Gar-Dena in gear-dagum\", and not \"Hwæt! We Gar-Dena in gear-dagum\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Adopting this type of verse structure is therefore difficult and very restrictive, but somehow Heaney has managed to successfully use it almost flawlessly, unlike other translators.**\n",
      "The fact is, Unferth, if you were truly\n",
      "as keen or courageous as you claim to be\n",
      "Grendel would never have got away with\n",

      "or of vengeance arriving ever from this quarter --\n",
      "from the Victory-Shieldings, the shoulderers of the spear.\n",
      "He knows he can trample down you Danes\n",
      "to his heart's content, humiliate and murder\n",

      "and brings another daybreak to the world. (ll. 590-606)\n",
      "\n",
      "Try reading it out loud (or listening to the audiobook). The metre is so melodious and strong; it's brilliant. Tactfully voicing Beowulf's attitude, Heaney also finds space to incorporate a cheeky chiasmus (see what I did there?) into the line \"of your blade making a mizzle of his blood\" found in the bl-m-m-bl alliteration. Heaney admits to have preferred \"forthright delivery, which led one critic to write that:\n",
      "[W]e sorely miss the craggy, bejeweled difficulty of the original in Heaney's flattened-out \"directness of utterance.\" [...] It is both restrained and exuberant, often ironic, oblique, ceremonial, sometimes sententious.***\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from Heaney's excellence and display of poetic skill in adopting the conventions and features of OE poetry, he manages to convey the strength the narrator tries to bring across, and it becomes easy to imagine how poets may have recited verses such as these in mead-halls.****\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, Heaney sometimes makes unlikely choices and overuses alliteration, fails to express the nuances of the Old English kennings, and loses the fortitude of the original.\n",

      "God-cursed Grendel came greedily loping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first line is heavy with the sounds of Grendel's heavy gait, which is continued in the second line. The trod is lacking from the first translated line, and Heaney's rendition of the second line contains an assonance of \"gr\", \"cur\" and \"k\", instead of the \"g\" found in the original, which, like Chickering points out transforms Grendel 'into a sort of hyena' (p. 116) and reduces him to something with an animistic appetite, not a monster that no one has been able to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Heaney sometimes loses sight of the sound of the original, the mood it conveys, but it is difficult to see how in modern English you can replicate that assonance satisfactorily. In my opinion, Heaney's translation, although by no means perfect, is the best I have come across in terms of imitation of rhyme. Other translators often offer literal translations which pay no attention to metre or any forms of rhyme, and care only for meaning. As with any translation, there will never be one that will be able to capture the linguistic beauty of Beowulf.\n",

If you are reading this for school or university, however, you might miss the original Old English. That is why I own an additional version, a bilingual edition published by Faber & Faber, of Heaney's translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another treat, however, is the audiobook of Beowulf read by Heaney, who does a magnificent job. It is, unfortunately, abridged, but Heaney's voice, the metre of his translation, and the story itself make it a five-star experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes\n",
      "* Strictly speaking, in poetry, alliteration is the repetition of the initial consonant sounds: \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers\". However, in verse which relies upon metre (lift/stressed and dip/unstressed syllables), this often means the stress will lie on the second syllable. Ironically, the word \"alliteration\" itself has its stress on the \"l\" and not the \"a\". Therefore, \"bold Beowulf\" alliterates, whereas \"between brethren\" does not. The terms \"alliteration\", \"initial rhyme\", \"beginning rhyme\", and \"head-rhyme\" are often use interchangeably. In the Old English, however, the alliteration/head-rhyme often falls on past participles of weak verbs which frequently begin with \"ge-\" or \"be-\" (e.g. gefremedon, past indicative plural of fremman). The stress, though, falls on \"gefremedon\", not \"gefremedon\", like \"between\". The authoritative text book on Old English is Peter S. Baker's Introduction to Old English, which can be found online or bought at Amazon USA and UK, Book Depository USA/International and UK, and AbeBooks USA and UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "** In May 2013, [a:Christopher Tolkien|9533|Christopher Tolkien|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1235772383p2/9533.jpg] published his father's fragmentary poem [b:The Fall of Arthur|16075147|The Fall of Arthur|J.R.R. Tolkien|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349706081s/16075147.jpg|21870230] written in alliterative verse. Christopher included an appendix explaining the basics to Old English verse. He, however, argues that alliteration is the repetition of neighbouring sounds (assonance (normally defined as the repetition of vowel sounds, not consonants)) and is not limited to the initial letters. To him, \"certain\" and \"uncertain\", therefore, is an example of alliteration and assonance, but should be avoided; for he believes Old English alliterative verse is actually head-rhyme. All in all, it's murky territory.\n",

It picked up at the end, but the first two thirds, I think, mostly highlighted the weaknesses in Dahl's style in general. He typically makes up for his weak writing with interesting concepts -- and that just wasn't the case here.\n",

      "\n",
      "I also found the scales to be all wrong. There are frequent comparisons of giant features to real world objects (ears as big as truck tires) and even actual numbers given to heights and sizes. They are very impressive comparisons but then when the practical explanations come up they don’t make sense. For example the little girl of the story — who is supposed to be nine, is able to hide in one of the folds of the giant’s ear. Either they are very big truck tires or she is a very small little girl.\n",

It's so easy for authors to fall into an episodic adventure where only a few threads tie the ending back to earlier parts in the book, but this one feels so intentional with natural transitions. The BFG doesn't eat humans like the other giants, so what does he eat? A repulsive vegetable called a snozzcumber. It's on the table for Sophie to hide in when another giant appears. It comes up a lot, the BFG is convinced to dine with the Queen when told the fare is far better, and the giants they capture at the end must eat snozzcumbers in their prison pit. This is just one of many; it feels as if every line in the book is intentional and nothing is wasted. \n",

      "Ho conosciuto Roald Dahl con \"La fabbrica di cioccolato\" ma non avevo mai letto nulla di lui. Fino al giorno in cui ho regalato alla mia cara cuginetta il romanzo del già citato film e ovviamente ho dato una rapida sbirciatina alla storia... Che dire? Fenomenale! Scrittore di alto umorismo, grande narratore per bambini. Brevemente ecco una sua veloce biografia: Roald Dahl è considerato uno dei più grandi scrittori di libri per bambini mai esistito. Nato nel 1916 da una famiglia di origini norvegesi, si trasferì ben presto in Gran Bretagna dove partecipò alla seconda guerra mondiale come pilota. Nel 1943 scrisse il suo primo libro per bambini, The Gremlins, da cui la Disney trasse un soggetto per un'animazione mai realizzata e a cui si ispirò Chris Columbus nel 1984 per il film che rese famose queste creature. Nel 1961 Dahl inizia la vera e propria carriera di scrittore per l'infanzia con James e la pesca gigante, seguito dai conosciutissimi La fabbrica di cioccolato, Il grande ascensore di cristallo (che ne è il seguito), Gli Sporcelli, La magica medicina, Il GGG, Le Streghe, Matilde e molti altri libri di successo. Le sue opere sono tradotte in trentaquattro lingue, hanno venduto milioni di copie nel mondo e vinto premi prestigiosi. È morto nel 1990 ma ogni anno si celebra il Roald Dahl Day in occasione del giorno del suo compleanno.\n",
      "Il GGG è un gigante buono, anzi l'unico buono tra gli altri suoi consimili che invece preferiscono mangiare bambini e popolli (così chiamano gli esseri umani) e si divertono a farsi grandi scorpacciate. Ma il GGG è vegetariano, mangia solo centrionzoli (di sapore pessimo) e raccoglie i sogni col retino per poi soffiarli, di notte, ai bambini. E proprio una notte la piccola Sofia lo vede e viene portata nella sua tana, piena zeppa di contenitori di sogni con tanto di targhetta per distinguerli. Da qui nasce la dolce amicizia fra la bimba e il gigante buono, fino all'epilogo punitivo verso i cattivi mangiatori di bambini.\n",
      "Un romanzo dolcissimo, semplice ma appassionante, dallo stile inconfondibile. Un libro che ha fatto storia, amato dai grandi e dai piccini, un’opera che non può mancare nelle vostre librerie.\n",
      "Ah, il GGG significa Grande Gigante Gentile.\n",
      "4.0\n",
      "Just like the rest of Roald Dahl's imaginative works, The BFG is a silly and whimsical story filled with nonsense words and undertones of racism. While all of his novels are creative and fun, there are certain elements that shouldn't be overlooked. This book was originally published in 1982 and with giants going to different countries to eat different-tasting humans, there are times when people of different ethnic backgrounds are defined by pun-based stereotypes and cases where certain word choices are noticeably out-dated. The term \"hottentot\" shouldn't be in any book unless it's trying to be historically accurate and showcase past cases of severe racism, let alone a contemporary children's novel.\n",

But aside from that, I can't say much for this book since I'm not the age demographic it's for. Since it is made for 6-8-year-olds but if I were to read this at that age I would've definitely been traumatized and paranoid at the fact that a giant could come and eat me during the night.

      "Its sins are few and small, but they exist and eff that sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sin #1: Girls and boys are not so different, Mr. Dahl. Dahl assumes that girls and boys are so different that a dream that a boy would like would be confusing to a girl and vice versa. We live in a world where the male and female experience are (finally) being recognized as pretty damn similar, especially when they are young. I am cool with any piece of literature aimed at children that tries to dissuade kids from believing that truth disappearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sin #2: There are no female giants? Giants just spontaneously appear? Again with the sexism, THANKS ROALD. For no reason that I can see, Dahl decides that giants can only be dudes. Maybe it was too hard to figure out how to draw lady giants in loin cloths? I don't know, but I don't like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sin #3 Liiiiiittle bit racist. The giants seem like racial caricatures. I will grant that this could just be me being a little too sensitive, but then Dahl also includes a conversation in his book between the Queen of England and the Sultan (?) of Baghdad wherein the Sultan tells her:\n",

      "\n",
      "Spoiler\n",
      "There are some very disturbing questions that Dahl raises about what it means to be loyal to a species and how humanity fails itself in ways that giants don't. Until we meet the BFG. The BFG is theoretically the hero of the story because he betrays his species in order to save humans from being gobbled up by giants at night. It is directly through the actions of the BFG that his entire species winds up in a giant hole eating snozzcumbers for the rest of their lives. He enslaves his entire species and, because he did so for the benefit of humanity, we are supposed to praise him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pretty sure that I know Dahl well enough to know that he doesn't actually want people to like the BFG. He was trying to spark a conversation about what a good global citizen looks like. But he coated it really, really well and I would LOVE to spark this conversation with kids, but I'm not going to because of the mildly sexist and racist elements.\n",

Perhaps because I expected to have the same childhood reading adventure as I had with those books, I liked, but did not love, The BFG. I think that Dahl's idea for the story is a creative one, but little things, such as the puns on the names of countries when the BFG describes the taste of \"human beans\" in those countries, or what I think were stereotypical remarks at the end of the novel. For instance, when Dahl describes thankful world leaders bestowing gifts upon Sophie and the BFG for saving their people from man-eating giants, he writes that \"The Rule of India sent the BFG a magnificent elephant...The King of Arabia sent them a camel each. The Lama of Tibet sent them a llama each\" (pp. 204-5). However, to me, the worst line was when the Queen of England called the Sultan, \"next best thing\" to a Lord Mayor to ask him whether any of his subjects had mysteriously disappeared recently, and he responds, \"Every night unpleasant things are happening in Baghdad...We are chopping off people's heads like you are chopping parsley\" (p. 174).\n",

Some would also say that these things are \"just jokes,\" that they were silliness written for the amusement of children. In spite of the fact that the novel was written over two decades ago, I do not think that children should just absorb these lines, because they are most likely reading this book at the suggestion of an adult who is, in their mind, only supposed to give them \"good\" books.

      "Another niggling doubt about the book was the resolution with the giants being imprisoned in a giant pit, doomed to eat disgusting snozzcumbers for the rest of their lives. I think that Dahl was well-intentioned in including the conversation between the BFG and Sophie about how humans make their own rules, and giants make their own rules and that the rules don't coincide. When I got to this conversation, which included the the BFG basically telling Sophie that it was somewhat judgmental or short-sighted of her to immediately think of the other giants as bad, because humans, unlike giants, kill their own kind all the time, I thought that the story was incredibly promising. However, the story ended as they typically do, especially in \"children's\" literature, with the \"bad\" guys getting captured and the \"good\" guys living happily ever after without the moral ambiguity that Dahl touched upon in that one particular conversation between Sophie and the BFG. I think that it might have been more interesting if it was ever brought up that perhaps giants just eat humans just as humans eat bacon, sausage, and eggs, just as Sophie, the BFG, and the Queen did at the end of the story, and that perhaps the solution would be to respect all life, just as the BFG always had (before uncharacteristically eating all that bacon and sausage at the end of the novel) because he could hear the world's suffering. Instead, as I mentioned, the story has a more typical ending, and it is emotionally acceptable that the human-eating giants are imprisoned with disgusting food for the rest of their lives (and the Queen is humane for imprisoning them rather than killing them, to boot) only because Dahl portrays the giants as disgusting throughout the entire novel. Although the giants are portrayed as mean in the scene during which they toss around the BFG, emphasis is continuously on how the giants are \"half-naked and disgusting\" in their appearance and smell. Thus, emphasis is placed on their physical, rather than moral disgustingness, and to me, this is too reminiscent of the way that we vilify those who are different than us to justify our inhuman treatment of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, although I enjoyed this book because of Dahl's creativity in coming up with a BFG and a dreamblower, etc, I don't think that it should hold such a coveted place in children's literature because it is somewhat outdated in its attitude, and there are many, many wonderful children's adventure novels out there with which to replace it. I think that it would be a good novel to discuss with kids, but I don't think that parents/teachers should just give it to kids an example of a \"good book\" because remember loving it during their childhood.\n",

I've said many good things about this book. Heck, I even liked it. I just pointed out that I don't think that it's perfect, my reasons for not thinking that it's perfect, and that there are plenty of great books out there for kids to read, so people should at least think a millisecond about what they recommend to kids (about the content, child's maturity, and child's personal preferences) instead of just pushing their own childhood favorites on them.\n",

      "This book came highly recommended from a friend... We were reading it with my 5 year old as one of his first few chapter books (we had already done a few others including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). I really struggled with it. I didn't like the story particularly. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily all that great either. And I would also say that for a child I find it inappropriate as a \"reading aloud\" book - because the abundance of made-up words results in more effort trying to explain what words are to a child that is still working on their own vocabulary. (Not to mention its hard on the adult in order to pronounce things incorrectly on purpose). While my child had no issues with it, I found that the premise of giants that eat people might be a little disturbing to children. Again, my child didn't, but I would suggest reading this first before just starting it with your child. I would have skipped reading it with him had I done that.\n",

      "The story is about a plucky orphan, a humane Big Friendly Giant (or more precisely, a Small Friendly Giant because he is half the size of the other giants), and how he uses dreams to free humanity from the scourge of the giants “that is guzzling human beans” as the story phrases it. As usual, Roald Dahl’s imagination, both in terms of concepts but also the playfulness of the language, combined with the strength of his child heroes and humane sensibility make this a wonderful experience.\n",

      "I read this for my BBC challenge (http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/525189-megan-s-bbc-challenge) and was really excited about reading it. Most people on Goodreads have given it 5 stars and say it's one of their favorite Dahl books. Maybe I'm getting burned out on children's books (which I thought was impossible) but I was kind of disappointed by this one. Perhaps this is one of those books that you had to have read as a kid and have lots of warm fuzzy memories of in order to really appreciate it. Or maybe I should have been reading it to a kid so that I could have heard out loud all those crazy made-up words and how hilarious the fart jokes would be to a child (they did make me smirk though). I guess I should revert back to more adult-type books for a while so I can better appreciate these nonsensical whimsical childhood treasures.\n",
      "4.0\n",
      "I've read this one several times now and it's still a challenge to read out aloud. Roald Dahl's penchant for using made-up words is almost overplayed here. I certainly took inspiration from David Jason's excellent voice-acting in the animated movie (I've not yet seen the live-action film).\n",
      "As for the story, each chapter brings something new and fresh but in bite-sized portions so there's no 'info-dump' to get bogged down in. If anything, there's very little information about the giants and giant country given and what little there is, only compounds the mystery. However, in this case, answers aren't necessarily needed as we are swept along as Sophie shows the BFG just what he has been brought into existence to do.\n",

      "Aren't your favourite childhood authors the best? Like Judy Blume, Roald Dahl was another leading light for me during my middle grade years and I have such wonderful memories of reading his books over and over again. In fact, I think I read my copy of The BFG so many times that the pages literally starting coming out of the book and I was forced to replace it with a bright, shiny new one. Never a problem for a bookworm, right? Reading Roald Dahl also fills me with warm fuzzy feelings for my sister, Chrissi Reads as when we were younger, I used to read stories like this, Matilda and Charlie and The Chocolate Factory as her bedtime stories before she dropped off to sleep. Who better to re-read The BFG as an adult with than Chrissi on our Kid-Lit challenge? Would the story stand the test of time? It was time to find out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered the world of The BFG and his little friend, Sophie with a bubble of anticipation and joy in my heart combined with a smug, tiny feeling that was impossible to shake. There was no way Roald Dahl would let me down as an adult! I was hugely confident of that fact. However, I wasn't prepared for how charmed and delighted I would feel re-visiting the world that Dahl has created. The author has a peculiar, unique sort of talent for writing stories that appeal to both children and adults alike and his free, easy way with words, classic humour and unforgettable characters makes for such a rewarding reading experience that it's always a pleasure to sit down with one of his works, no matter what age it's geared towards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, I don't think I can talk about the magic of Roald Dahl's writing without mentioning the gorgeousness of the illustrations that accompany these great words by the fantastic, inimitable Quentin Blake. I adore the vivid, beautifully imaginative drawings that bring each character's personality to life so vibrantly, it becomes impossible to think of a character such as The BFG without also thinking of those glorious, big-eared images too. Finally, who couldn't fail to become enamoured by Dahl's characters themselves - a humble, whizzpopping, big friendly giant who gets his words mixed up to hilarious effect but has a heart of pure gold and is devastated by the thought of hundreds of innocent \"human beans,\" being gobbled up every night! He and Sophie make the perfect team to rid the world of the blood-thirsty evil giants and I could read about their adventures for days on end.\n",

      "Vi o filme há muitos anos, com a minha mãe, e lembro-me que chorámos imenso. Fiquei completamente atordoada pela história, pela inocência do Bruno e pela crueldade dos nazis. Li o livro sem me lembrar de pormenores muito específicos do filme, por isso, muita coisa foi nova para mim, tanto que nem sei dizer se o filme é fiel à história original.\n",
      "Bruno é um rapaz de 9 anos, o pai é comandante nazi, e ele muda-se com a família para um campo de concentração: Out-With, como ele o pronúncia, e que nos faz remeter logo para Auschwitz (quando me apercebi do trocadilho, fiquei K.O.). Ele não entende nada do que se está a passar o livro inteiro, isto porque é muito inocente. É uma criança muito pura, com um coração bom. É a típica criança que não conhece o mal e que sempre viveu rodeada de coisas boas (excepto, talvez, a disciplina rígida que o pai impõe em casa). Ele nem sabe muito bem quem é Hitler, não sabe o que são judeus, campos de concentração, e daí chamar ao amigo, que ele conhece na nova casa, o rapaz do pijama às riscas.\n",
      "Isto fez-me alguma confusão de início, como é que não lhe ensinaram estas coisas, ainda para mais sendo o rapaz filho de um nazi de alto comando. Mas, tendo em conta que a avó do Bruno (a mãe também me pareceu, embora menos), é completamente contra o trabalho do pai do Bruno e vê como uma atrocidade tudo o que a Alemanha está a fazer aos judeus, até que faz sentido. O pai também não passa muito tempo com ele, pelo que dá para entender que a educação do Bruno é de uma criança que não pertenceu à juventude hitleriana. Portanto, o livro auto-explica neste aspecto, que pode ser uma falha, mas a meu ver não o é.\n",
      "Também temos a noção disto tudo, porque a história é contada em terceira pessoa pelo ponto de vista do Bruno, assim, temos acesso aos seus pensamentos, desejos e conflitos internos. E é a coisa mais bonita de se ler, porque ele é bom, aliás, os pais ensinaram-no a ser bom, correcto e respeitador. E quando ele vê uma criança judia, ele vê-la como uma amiga com quem falar e sair do tédio. A sua inocência chega a ser engraçada no seu dia a dia, porque ele não entende nada dos problemas complicados do mundo, ele vê o mundo de uma forma muito simples. É impossível não adorar este miúdo, o autor soube muito bem escrever sobre uma criança.\n",
      "Já conhecia o final, pelo filme, e passei a segunda metade do livro completamente ansiosa, quase como que sufocada, porque não podia fazer nada para evitar esse mesmo final. Apesar de o livro abordar muito mais o lado alemão da segunda guerra, não deixa de ser um livro importante, que demonstra como todos deveríamos ser, inocentes e bondosos, sem maldade para dar e vender. E mostra como foi fácil para uma criança alemã dos anos 40, sem os contornos da sociedade da época, entender e gostar de uma criança judia. Recomendo a toda a gente, inclusivé, acho que este livro, lado a lado com O diário de Anne Frank, é uma boa iniciação para dar a entender aos mais novos o que foi o Nazismo.\n",

Until he meets Shmuel, a boy who lives in a strange parallel existence on the other side of the adjoining wire fence and who, like the other people there, wears a uniform of striped pyjamas. Bruno’s friendship with Shmuel will take him from innocence to revelation and in exploring what he is unwittingly a part of, he will inevitably become subsumed by the terrible process. \n",

I'm glad that John Boyce did this from a young child’s point of view rather than the soldiers or someone older from the camp. I loved the friendship side of it, and I would have loved for Bruno and Shmuel to have survived and been best friends. Both characters have their own personality, and I would have loved to get additional chapters from Shmuel, I think that would have been a heartbreaking but an interesting perspective especially because Bruno seems to be in the dark about the “thousands of people on the other side of the fence” but Shmuel knew what he was and why he was there.  \n",

      "The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas is very cleverly written, Bruno’s point of view is raw, without a filter but also slightly disappointing. The thing is, Bruno would know who “The Führer” is and not “the fury”, as he interprets it. Same thing goes for “Auschwitz” instead of “Out-With”. Little children of nazi’s in that time and setting, would know exactly what the words meant and who or what they were. Bruno knows nothing which makes it a bit unrealistic. The fences in Auschwitz were heavily electric, as told by survivors. Which makes it odd for Bruno and Shmuel to shake hands, crawl under it (as for the ending), and most of all; Shmuel not getting caught by tower guards!\n",
      "I was annoyed by these little but important details.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it’s a fiction book and I didn’t let the little historic mistakes bother me from enjoying the book. I first read the book secretly at my grandma’s house when I was about nine years old (Bruno’s age). At the time I was really interested in World War II, so much it was almost obsessive like. It wasn’t much of a surprise of course, when I wanted to read “The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas” after noticing it in her bookshelf. My grandma didn’t want me to read it because she thought (and was right) that it was too much for a little nine year old. So I snuck it from the bookshelf and read it secretly at home. At the time I didn’t quite understand the whole situation, but I got the main story and also understood the ending. It left a big impression on me and when a friend of mine told me she just reread the book, I was inspired to also, read it again. This time it didn’t leave such an impression on me. In fact, after reading it, I didn’t wander around with the book in my mind for a few days, which is what usually happens when I finish a book. Maybe this was because I read it seven years ago, but that’s quite a long time. The book felt like a children’s book with a dark twist. The writing is childbook-ish like, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s just a very quick and easy read without - for me - much depth, because you already know what’s coming and everything seems so obvious. Maybe that’s the trick of the book. I think they did a great job on the movie too. This time I can’t say whether I think the book or the movie is better. Normally for me it’s a no-brainer: the book is usually my answer. But this time I felt like the movie was more adult and the book childish. I don’t think I will read it again, so I will finally return the book to my grandma, sorry grandma!\n",

I certainly had no idea of world events that were going when I was 9. I don't know how sheltered Bruno's life in Berlin may have been, but I have to say it does seem a bit far-fetched to think that he has no idea of who Jews were.\n",

He loves his father and mother and trusts them completely and yet he can tell something is going on... It is slightly unbelievable that a Commandant wouldn't be raising his son with Nazi-filled thoughts but seeing Bruno discover the terribleness of the war and also pointlessness of it is so beautiful. Here is a little boy who should be filled with hate his Father and country spews but instead he sees Shmuel as just a friend. There is no difference between them except the fence that separates their homes. They were even born on the same day! When he hears Shmuel being called a Jew, he doesn't see it as a dirty term or as anything disgusting or bad.

Unfortunately, Bruno (protagonist) learns the nuances of the world a little too late (that is, not everything is black or white). And the preservation of his innocence is arguably what lead him to his death. All this to say, Boyne's writing and Bruno's characters are truly complementary, and as an author, Boyne truly shines in that regard. Along with his cast of strong characters who steered clear of most stereotypes, which rendered the cast more fleshed out and easier to connect with, without any clear \"preferred side\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, especially in today's sociological climate, I couldn't help but hold ambiguous feelings toward John Boyne being neither being German nor Jewish. I know some would even argue that it was \"not his story to tell\". This definitely affected my reading of the book. Not that I strongly side with one ideology or another in this specific case, but I can't deny I kept questioning whether it was Boyne's place to tell and shed light on these tragic events. For better or worse, I ultimately think he did a wonderful job of telling his story, and by no means do I wish to discredit his efforts and hard work. Contextually, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was, after all, written in a different climate. It would be wrong not to acknowledge this fact. And, while I might not make a clear stand here, it would be dishonest of me to say that this ambiguity did not reflect on my final grading of the book. Reading it in our current time does mean our understanding and appreciation of a work is informed by different lenses and worldviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I want to address the decent and predictable plot. The story IS a good one, and because it is so rooted into reality, Bruno's story is at times unique and common. The predictability of the events that occur in the story is not, in my opinion, a flaw or weak point to highlight. In fact, I would argue that this predictability strengthen the plot. It is faithful to the horrific acts that did historically occur during World War II. And while Bruno and Shmuel' specific friendship and story probably never happened, the reality is that similar stories are likely to have occurred. And the conditions and lifestyle of both boys is surely relatable to many others who grew up in these troubled times.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, this is a loaded book. It is worth to read, it is a good book. And if one can overlook Boyne outsider's p.o.v. and treat the book as a work of fiction — which it is— then I recommend giving it a try. It is a quick but heavy read.\n",

      "I didn't like the beginning. It didn't instantly hook me and I really didn't like the characters, as I felt that the protagonist, Bruno, sounded like a spoilt nine year old, whiny boy.

Shmuel and Bruno's friendship is adorable, and I definitely understand why this book is so beloved. I recommend this to everyone.\n",

      "Oh man, this book surprised me. Our protagonist, Bruno, is a 9 year old German boy with a nazi father. The family relocates from Berlin to “Out-With” (Auschwitz) and the narrative follows the adjustments he and his family make under the reign of “the fury.” With a few comparisons to Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, Bruno’s idea of exploration and naive mindset of heroism leads him to explore the outskirts of a concentration camp. The very real danger of the world is undermined by naive idea “nothing bad can happen to me” mentality and not understanding not everyone is equal. He meets a Jewish friend named Shmuel on the other side of a fence. The two boys become friends and through their friendship, we see the genius of innocence and dark history. Bruno is slightly annoying, but then again, so was Jim Hawkins. This is a fairly short story with a strong ending. A nice quick read.\n",

      "I wasn't originally planning on reading this book. I had heard a lot of good things about it and knew the main plot. A boy with a Nazi father meets a Jewish boy from the other side of the fence and they become friends. Yet I never really thought I would actually get around to reading it. A couple months ago though my brother decided to read this book for a school project. He explained a bit more about the plot and since I wasn't planning on reading it, he even told me the ending. Which for me was perfectly fine. But a couple of weeks ago I decided that I actually wanted to have my own experience reading this book, it feels like an important piece of literature to read at some point in your lifetime. So I read it. And honestly I'm pretty happy that I did. I liked the book quite a lot and whilst I didn't necessarily learn anything new about the terrible things that happened during the Holocaust, it was still very intriguing to read about the boy on the other side of the fence. \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite character honestly has to be him, the boy on the other side of the fence, Shmuel. Even though the perspective of this book was through Bruno's mind, I didn't really love his character as much. I felt much more connected to Shmuel in all honesty. Maybe that was the point, maybe the author did that on purpose so that people would take Shmuel's side and feel sorry for him but honestly who wouldn't? Either way, like I said, I didn't like Bruno all that much. He's supposed to be nine years old but he acts like he's six. He was annoying and thought everything was about him. Also, he was described as smart, but it feels like a smart nine year old would easily be able to understand what the situation was without having to have it spelt out to him by his sister. Especially if he can literally see everything from his window. And his complaints were just so annoying. Like he complained about not having a five floor house. Maybe all nine year olds act like this but I definitely don't remember being like this when I was younger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something that I did like though, was the way the story was narrated. Whilst it might be annoying to some people to have to be inside the mind of a nine year old, to me it was interesting to be reminded of how innocent a child's brain is, they never think the worst out of any situation. And I'm not sure if anyone else realized but something that I found very interesting was the use of the words Out-With and Fury. Both words which are used in the novel instead of Auschwitz and Führer (meaning leader, a.k.a. Hitler) since Bruno doesn't know what the words actually are. But they also have another meaning if you think about it. I won't say the second meaning here because it's better if you figure it out yourself but it's just something that I found that was very interesting to me. Again I don't know if this is a known fact though.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt slightly like not much happened until the end but since it was a really short book, that didn't annoy me that much and I wasn't really too bored. Either way the importance of a book like this easily overcomes any slight boredom that may have occured at some point during the book. It is extremely important to have this as a piece of literature even if it's just to remind us of the things that happened. I would recommend this to a slightly younger audience though. Of course adults can still read this and possibly enjoy it but it did feel a bit childish to me sometimes. I think that a younger audience would not only enjoy it more but also learn more from reading a book like this whilst adults may enjoy other literature about the Holocaust instead.\n",

Bruno’s father is a very important man in the German army, and in this story he becomes the commandant of Auschwitz (which Bruno thinks is called ‘Out-with’, even after being corrected by both his father and Gretel). They move to a house close to the camp, where Bruno hates it. There are soldiers all over the house, one of them being Lieutenant Kotler who’s just an ass. Then, one day Bruno decides to go exploring. He meets Shmuel, a Jewish boy who’s in Auschwitz with his brother, father and grandfather. The two become friends and they tell each other stories about their lives.\n",

      "One thing that bothered me was the fact that Bruno seemed oblivious to the things that were happening in the camp. He thought Auschwitz was called ‘Out-With’, that the Führer was called ‘The Fury’, he had no idea what the word ‘Jew’ meant, and I just found it hard to believe that. He’s the son of the commandant of the camp, a very important man in the German army, and he doesn’t know all that stuff? His sister was supposed to be a member of the BDM for two years already, and he was supposed to become a member of that other group (of which I have forgotten the name, oh damn) in a year, when he turns ten.\n",

Also, the downside of this was, it created a sense of detachment while I read the book. Because Bruno had no idea what was going on and knew nothing of the horrors Shmuel faced, his lack of emotion was transmitted to the reader.

Bruno är ignorant och fattar inte vad som händer men det är ju klart han är ju ett barn. I efterordet skriver han också nått i ton men ”Två pojkar, båda som har tvingats åka till ställen dom inte vill vara på under hemska omsatser” Jag fattar inte hur man kan gemföra att vara i ett koncentrationsläger med att bo i ett trevåningshus med hela sin familj och full frihet???????\n",

      "The plot of the narrative takes place during World War II, and it focuses on an odd bond that develops between two young boys who live on opposite sides of a fence that divides a concentration camp. Bruno, a German kid who is nine years old, is the story's primary protagonist. His father, Ralf, is a high-ranking Nazi official in the Third Reich. When Ralf is given the responsibility of being the commandant of a concentration camp, Bruno's family is forced to leave their pleasant home in Berlin and move to a bleak territory known as \"Out-With.\"\n",

Bruno strikes up a friendship with Shmuel, both out of curiosity and because he is ignorant of the atrocities that are taking place on the other side.\n",

Bruno, as a result of his interactions with Shmuel, starts to have second thoughts about the ideas held by his family as well as the behavior of his father and the Nazi dictatorship. The boys' connection allows them to find peace in spite of the fact that they come from quite different origins and share very diverse experiences.\n",

Bruno is intrigued by the grounds and the people in “striped pajamas” who sometimes talk to the soldiers and sometimes “fall to the ground like they are sleeping and sometimes they do not get up.” On an exploratory mission of the fence surrounding the property, Bruno encounters a boy his age named Shmuel, who lives on the other side and does not seem to be very happy. Bruno and Shmuel begin an unlikely friendship, finding they have more in common than they would think. As life at Out-With becomes more confusing for Bruno, his time with Shmuel is a comfort, but it may also lead to catastrophic consequences for them both.\n",

I’ve also read criticism that, for Holocaust literature, this book focuses too much on the experience of Bruno and less of that of Shmuel, which is entirely fair. But I appreciate the ability to see these events through childlike eyes and learn about them in new ways.\n",

Bruno is supposed to be 9, but he has no idea who the Fuhrer is, has no idea what the word \"Jew\" means, and thinks Heil Hitler is a fancy way of saying goodbye; even though his father is a high ranking Nazi official. He \"mishears\" Auschwitz and the Fuhrer as \"Out-with\" and \"The Fury\". He acts more like he's 5. He's ignorant, annoying, and immature. This is supposed to be a fable, but what moral was learned, by any of the characters? Don't trust your friends? It doesn't make sense to me. At the back of the version I got, there was a question and answer with the author, and he ADMITS he wrote it in about a week and a half, because \"it would be a mistake to stop\". It definitely shows. My suggestion? Don't waste your time. There are far better books out there that actually teach morals that make sense and are obvious to everyone. The whole book was just annoying.\n",

I felt nostalgic reading about a story that so long ago made me cry. It was an afternoon reading, I sat on the couch after lunch and only got up in the late afternoon when I finished the book. It is a sad book, yes, but it is also beautiful and reflective. During the narrative, I thought a lot about the lyrics to Taylor Swift's \"Cardigan\" where she sings that when you are young, they assume you know nothing. Books like this show me that we've always known everything, the world just makes us believe we don't. Children know more about the world than many adults out there, and I will believe that forever.\n",

The girls are all treated terribly, with the exception of A) the woman that Jess has a crush on and B) the little girl who's \"not like other girls\". Jess even punches one of his sisters in the face, and neither of his parents ever say a word about it because he's going through ~emotions~ (which is the most blatant co-signing of the idea that boys cannot be expected to handle their emotions and that boys can only be expected to express their emotions via anger and physical violence). Meanwhile, Leslie is the child version of a manic pixie dream girl, and the entire emotional weight of the story is in how she gets fridged.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a lesser extent, the book also has problems with endorsing body-shaming, abuse, and Christian supremacy. The book goes out of its way to hatefully mock its overweight characters (there's a whole imagine spot about a teacher being sent to \"one of those fat farms\" where she will be \"publicly humiliated in front of all the other fat ladies\"); it heartily endorses the idea that reporting abuse is a \"betrayal\" and a failure on the part of the victim to \"protect\" their abuser; it goes out of its way to make clear that the soon-to-be-dead little girl is an agnostic/atheist character, and then proceeds to make it clear that her own opinions about religion do not matter and that she will absolutely be going to heaven anyway because, again, the choices of atheists and agnostics do not matter when they might stand in the way of Christians doing and thinking what they want.\n",

Leslie suggested they needed a secret place to play and took him to the other side of the river. In this place, their imaginations were at play.

      "\n",
      "I couldn't help but identify with Jesse almost instantly. The need for freedom that was gnawing on his insides, the sh*tload of burdens that were laid on his shoulder even though he was just ten; all the running he was doing to escape his own fears. To put it the way Kathrine would, \"Lord, there was a lot of pain in the world for a ten-year-old to take in.\" Or something among those lines.\n",

      "\n",
      "Paterson deals with complicated topics in her books. I do not recommend this. In fact, I think it's a bad idea and something that authors should, as a rule, try to stay away from. Mishandling a delicate topic is probably the single most destructive thing an author could do. Topics like the ones she writes about - relational issues between family members and people's distorted views of God and religion being two such topics that appear in both Bridge To Terabithia and Jacob Have I Loved - mean either the instant death or instant celebrity of a novel: handle them the wrong way and failure is unavoidable. Paterson, however, has the rare gift of handling difficult topics with skill. I think this is particularly evident in Bridge To Terabithia.\n",

      "Bridge To Terabithia is a small book - only about two hundred pages long - and took me roughly two hours to read, but while there were, as always, a few things about Paterson's writing style that annoyed me, this book has a big impact and was deeply personal for me.\n",

      "This book breaks my heart. Jess is really only a child, and yet he acts much older. Even more shocking is how old May Belle, who is just six, acts.

      "Jess is a talented child, but he feels the tacit disapproval of the adults in his life, which leads him to believe he is weird and that being an artist is not acceptable for a boy. This causes him to hide his talent and his real feelings, because he desperately craves approval - especially his father's. The adults in Jess' life are so scarred themselves that they cannot care for Jess properly. Hurting parents hurt their children, without wanting or meaning to, and this is especially true of Jess. When Jess' father pays him any attention at all, it is in the form of criticism and harshness and too-high expectations. But Jess would never tell this to anyone, because he feels that it is his duty to hide his parents' misdeeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from his six-year-old little sister, May Belle, Jess despises his sisters. His two older sisters for their demanding self-centeredness, and his four-year-old sister for her timidity. Jess is disgusted to find that he emulates the behaviors he so despises in his sisters, but finds himself unable to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps because of these painful circumstances, Jess has a distorted view of nearly everything around him. His parents, siblings, friendship, school, God, and his own value are all colored by how well his most basic needs for love and acceptance are met. Jess has exactly one positive adult influence in his life: his young, free-spirited music teacher, the only person who encourages Jess to draw, and is therefore the object of all his young, unrealistic passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Leslie seems like the hero of this story, Leslie is the one who takes Jess away from May Belle, causing her to become lonely and resentful of her older brother. And if Leslie hadn't died, the barriers between Jess and his father would never have finally broken down, allowing them to connect in a way that Jess had been needing his whole life. His father is able to comfort Jess, holding him while he cries. Leslie's death also makes Jess realize that he has been unreasonable and judgmental about other people. Mrs. Meyers, a teacher he had thought of as hypocritical and hard, he realizes, is a kind, caring woman with her own story of hurt to share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jess is painfully aware of the stark contrast between he and Leslie: she is bright and vivacious and he is slow and fearful.

      "The 2007 movie based on the book fell, in my opinion, epically short of the ideal. AnaSophia Robb highlights all of Leslie's friendly sweetness and imagination without any of the anger or selfishness or loneliness that comes through so clearly in the book. Both Robb and Josh Hutcherson, who plays Jess with only mediocre success, are simply too old to play ten-year-old kids.

At first, I don't like the whole thinking that I will read a book like this, for me it's for children only, But then I got curious because my friend told me it's a good read so then I try and it got me to the point that I read it two times.\n",

      "+In 1976, Katherine Paterson's son David was 8 years old when his friend, Lisa Hill, was struck by lightning and killed. A year later Bridge to Terabithia was published, winning a Newberry Medal and becoming, if such a thing is possible an instant classic.\n",
      "\n",
      "+Ms. Paterson drew upon this personal tragedy to create the story of a boy, Jess Aarons, and a girl, Leslie Burke, in rural Virginia, who become the best of friends. Jess is the middle child, and only son, of a reticent father, who struggles to earn a living. Leslie is the daughter, an only child, of two successful writers who have moved to the country, next door to the Aarons, for lifestyle reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "+The friendship between the two kids is hesitant at first, particularly after Leslie usurps Jess's title as the fastest runner in their 5th-grade class at Lark Creek Elementary. But both have some trouble fitting in with their peers, Jess because of his interest in Art, Leslie because of her scholastic ability and her parents' very 70's social attitudes (like not having a TV), and this shared awkwardness gives them a unique bond. Leslie creates an imaginary kingdom called Terabithia for them to rule over, accessible only by a rope swing over a local creek. The imaginary adventures they share there and a series of incidents at school bring the two closer and closer together. But then an ugly reality intrudes upon their idyllic world and the various characters are forced to deal with a tragic death. To say more might ruin the story, so let's leave it at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "+Jess is an enjoyable character, whose interest in the arts and talent for drawing is inspiring, especially when you take into account that his parents don't shed any encouragement upon him. His crush on Miss Edmunds is also notable, for it really showcases the special relationship and bond that students are able to establish with certain teachers. However, from the moment she stepped into the book, it was Leslie who captured my attention. From her introduction at the end of Chapter Two, Leslie left a mark on my mind. She is a profound character, whose thoughts and outlook on life are remarkable. Her ability to conceal her mischievous mind behind raw intelligence is hilarious, but it is her mature musings on just about everything that she encounters, and her kindness that truly make her appealing.\n",
      "\n",
      "+I can honestly say that, no matter how many books I read in the course of my lifetime, Leslie Burke will remain one of my favorite fictional characters for life. Paterson has penned a novel that makes one think and leaves room open for discussion regarding the various subjects discussed in this book. Subjects that many authors strive to avoid at all costs. A gripping, character-driven novel that leaves you trapped in thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "+Regarding other claims about this book that it is not for children, let us remember one thing. These are children in the book. They think like children. They act like children. Their friendships and ties and feelings are those of children. Adults and older teens tend to find this book \"boring\". It is not intended for adults, but for kids to read and grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "+It is not often that a book touches me in such a profound way that I continually think about the outcome long after the last page has been turned. That it nags at me in such a violent way that I can't concentrate on anything else. Yet, somehow, that is exactly the frame of mind that Katherine Paterson's BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA has left me in.\n",

Jess is used to life on the farm, tending to the cows and helping out with his sisters. One day, Leslie moves in and tries to befriend Jess but he doesn't really want anything to do with her, until one day. She is pretty relentless about trying to be his friend and decides to race on the boy's side of the playground in a race to find who is the fastest runner. After Jess has trained all summer, he is sure to be the fastest. Sadly, he (and all the other boys) are beaten by Leslie...a girl. Soon, Jess is mesmerized by her swiftness and they become best friends. They even find a secret place in the woods to build up an entire imaginary kingdom in which they are king and queen. However, this fairytale can't last forever. This story pulled at my heartstrings when I first watched the movie because I was not really an avid reader as a child so the film holds a special place in my heart. I am glad that I read the book finally but I did think the movie was a lot sadder. This book is really short and a good read, especially for fans of the movie. I was kind of thrown for a loop while reading just because of some of the fatphobic comments throughout the story (not sure if they were in the movie since it has been so long since I watched it) so just be aware that this is a recurring topic. Other than that, this book has an easy writing style, fast-pace, and a friendship that, for me, is incredibly relatable and makes me miss my childhood friends.\n",

And I think that was one of the few times that I cried for a justified reason when I was little. For once, not crying because I was a brat who didn't get my way, or my brother said something mean to me, but out of sorrow that had nothing to do with childishness.

I won't go into the details, but I would do little things where I would pretend to be the characters, or sometimes make references to them during school. I'm pretty sure every other child felt the same way (and adult for that matter) but all I wanted to do was climb a tree and stay in it after reading this. But it wasn't about finding a tree.

Z początku zwyczajnie wykonywał powierzone mu przez dorosłych zadania, nie będąc zbytnio zadowolonym, albo szczęśliwym.

I thought that the ending was sad but I don't feel that the book was long enough for me to have forged enough of a connection to be as brokenhearted as I probably should have been. Otherwise, I didn't really see the point to the book. I didn't understand why it got awards when I had to fight to get through reading it.\n",

Jack London has written so many incredible books and The Call of The Wild is one of those beautifully written and taught us how to acquire bravery, this royalty, loving, and caring bond between us humans and wild animals in such horrendous habitats. would recommend this book to everyone who hasn't!\n",

      "The Call of the Wild really drives home to me just how crazy it is that we continue to normalise animal labour in the same way we did centuries ago. The scenes here are stark and void of description, presenting the facts as they are in all their cold brutality, and it's really rough. The abuse and torture is almost unbearable to endure, but perhaps most unbearable is the acknowledgement that there is no going back after one (human or animal) has faced such cruelty, hardship, and callousness. You become the product of your circumstances, not out of want but out of simple necessity, and it's really heartbreaking to bear witness to.\n",

Much different from the other one, this one is much more about the wild nature of the animal. Though we still get to read about many lovable things dogs do. Definitely recommend this book to dog people.\n",

      "O livro de Jack London “The Call of the Wild” (O chamado selvagem)é uma história fascinante. É a história de um cachorro chamado Buck. Ele era um cão amável e adorado na fazenda de um grande juiz. Contudo, um dia foi raptado e vendido para homens maus e violentos que comercializava cães para puxar cargas em um treno no gelo. Esses cães eram uma mão de obra muito requisitada devido à corrida do ouro que estava ocorrendo nos Estados Unidos.\n",
      "Após sofrer maus tratos, ser espancado e passar por vários donos, Buck chega até John Thornton. Buck, devido a esses sofrimentos, se tornara um cão maligno, atacava com ou sem motivos. Era temido por todos os outros cães. No entanto, Buck agora amava seu dono com aquela devoção peculiar de um cão. Agora se sentia seguro e cuidado. Se tornara novamente um cão caseiro e domesticado.\n",

      "Nas noites de inverno, enquanto estava no acampamento, ele ouvia o latido das matilhas à distância e parecia-lhe o chamado para outra vida. Frequentemente, esse cão de natureza lupina deixava o acampamento e vagava pelas colinas cobertas de neve por dois ou três dias. A vida selvagem das planícies apertava seu coração e a única coisa que o impedia era seu amor pelo homem, seu querido dono, John Thornton.\n",

      "✍︎Nu as vrea sa incep sa relatez micul roman, astfel iata un sumar plin de senzatii. Romanul e unul dintre cele mai frumoase descrieri a lumii cainesti si a largului salbaticiei. Jack London foloseste nici prea putine, nici prea multe cuvinte pentru a face asta. Am gasit o doza perfecta de naratiune si descriere in aceasta carte. \"Chemarea strabunilor\" devine treptat un roman de la persoana observatorului la persoana care simte si traieste impreuna cu protagonistul, care e un caine, Buck. Aflandu-se intr-un moment din viata lui cand salbaticia devine tot de ce are nevoie el. Fiind un caine nascut si crescut intr-un camin omenesc, avand tot de ce are nevoi, dupa un incident, viata lui sufera o intorsatura de decor si spatiu, urmarind astfel lupta lui pentru supravietuire. Necesitatea de adaptare p/u a supravietui salbaticiei- Priveste, Invata, Adopta !; Salbaticia isi are partile sale dure, dar si frumusetea sa, perpetuata prin secole de stramosii canini. Toata aceasta supravietuire aici vine cu pretul de a-ti pierde moralul si firea, de a uita cine ai fost si de a deveni un nou tu. Lupta pentru suprematie si integritate printre neamul cainesc e molipsitoare si uneori distruge solidaritatea grupului, haitei, echipei. Insa lipsa disciplinei si a fricii de lider afecteaza relatiile intre camarazi, aparandu-se unii de altii si fiecare impunandu-si puterea. Salbaticia si libertatea cu care merge mana la mana nasc, starnesc instincte encenstrale, propulsate de energia si bucuria de a omori ceva viu. Buck era carne vie si forta de tractiune, castigul, trofeul sau era felia de peste dupa 200 de mile zilnic si 48 ore de odihna dupa 1200 mile facute. Asta nu e castig, asta e garantia ca Buck sa poata trage sania in continuare si satisface nevoilor omului. Cainii se duceau treptat, unul dupa altul. Insa moartea nu opreste omul din a-si indeplini scopul. Astfel, dupa un uragan de suferinte si osteneala, Buck intalneste adevarata iubire pura, pasionala. Un om pe nume John Thornton care ii salveaza viata si care ii arata lui Buck ca pentru a fi iubit si ingrijit, nu trebuie sa dai dovada de credinta in palma stapanului, in legea batei si a coltilor. John il iubea pe Buck ca pe un copil carui trebuie sa-i acorzi atentie, iubire, grija, joaca, hrana, dar si libertate. Buck devenise foarte atasat de John, ii era frica sa nu il piarda sau sa fie luat din nou de la stapan. Calatoreau mereu impreuna: prin paduri, lacuri inghetate, locuri nemaivazute. Insa Buck simtea chemarea care il striga. Chemarea strabunilor, urletul lupilor la lumina lunii. Stia ca nu va fi fericit daca nu alerga dupa chemare. Nu ar fi fost el. E ceea ce ne face vii ceea ce ne face sa fim una cu salbaticia, sangele strabunilor, chemarea strabunilor.\n",

      "I wouldn't want to start recounting the little novel, so here is a summary full of sensations. The novel is one of the most beautiful descriptions of the canine world and the wide wilderness. Jack London uses neither too few nor too many words to do this. I found a perfect dose of narration and description in this book. \"The Calling of the Ancestors\" gradually becomes a novel from the person of the observer to the person who feels and lives together with the protagonist, who is a dog, Buck. Being at a moment in his life when the wilderness becomes all he needs. Being a dog born and raised in a human home, having everything he needs, after an incident, his life suffers a turn of scenery and space, thus following his struggle for survival. The need to adapt to survive in the wild - Look, Learn, Adopt!; Wilderness has its harsh parts, but also its beauty, perpetuated through centuries by the canine ancestors. All this survival here comes with the price of losing your morale and nature, of forgetting who you were and becoming a new you. The fight for supremacy and integrity among the canine race is contagious and sometimes destroys the solidarity of the group, the pack, the team. But the lack of discipline and fear of the leader affects the relations between the comrades, defending each other and each imposing their power. The wildness and freedom that go hand in hand give birth to, arouse instinctual instincts, propelled by energy and the joy of killing something alive. Buck was living meat and traction force, his win, his trophy was the slice of fish after 200 miles daily and 48 hours of rest after 1200 miles done. This is not a gain, this is the guarantee that Buck can continue to pull the sled and satisfy the needs of man. The dogs went gradually, one after the other. But death does not stop man from fulfilling his purpose. Thus, after a hurricane of suffering and toil, Buck meets true pure, passionate love. A man named John Thornton who saves his life and who shows Buck that in order to be loved and cared for, you don't have to show your faith in the master's palm, in the law of the stick and tusks. John loved Buck like a child who needs attention, love, care, play, food, but also freedom. Buck had become very attached to John, he was afraid of losing him or being taken from his master again. They always traveled together: through forests, frozen lakes, unseen places. But Buck felt the call calling him. The call of the ancestors, the howling of wolves in the moonlight. He knew he wouldn't be happy if he didn't run after the call. It wouldn't have been him. It is what makes us alive, what does not make us one with the wild, the blood of the ancestors, the call of the ancestors.\n",

Anyway, this is the very compelling story of Buck, the well cared for pet dog of a wealthy California family who is stolen and sold for use on Alaskan sled teams during the Klondike gold rush. Buck first reluctantly adjusts to then thrives under his radical change of circumstances. The POV is Buck's and London manages that brilliantly.

It seems to be based on outdated ideas of alpha and beta, which have long since been disproven (see Shenkel [later writings & retractions,] Mech [later writings & retractions], Zimmerman.) Given the book was written in 1902, I don't blame London for getting the science of animal behavior wrong, but it makes me wonder what value the story has today. Additionally, London ascribes far too many human traits to the dogs for this to be an accurate picture of our understanding of animal behavior at that time. He ascribes traits like \"respect\" and \"love\" and \"forgiveness\" to the dogs, which would be alien to them beyond what humans project. Lastly, the idea that a pet dog, bred for domesticity and raised in a domestic household would become the leader of several packs is a fun story, but not at all accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I look at it as a metaphor for human relationships, I find it needlessly pessimistic. The idea that all animals and social structures are pulling to some sort of \"call of the wild\" is silly and absurd. Plus, the obsession London has with trying to be \"accurate\" about animal behaviors and \"feelings\" mars this so much that any meaningful metaphor is too obscure and muddied to be useful. Just as I don't see many insightful observations about dogs in this book, I see even less insightful observations about humans.\n",

And many of the personalities and occupations are believable as ones you would find in the far North at that time. Even if they all seemed a little broad and one-dimensional. I suppose thus are the limitations of trying to observe man through the eyes of a dog. Yet, it's disappointing to see the Anti-Native American sentiment that the books ends with. Buck is shown as a hero and the \"Indians\" are depicted as savage villains. Gold Rush Colonialism is only ever lightly criticized for 1) attracting some unsavory characters, and 2) some people didn't know how to do it very well. People like Thornton, who was capable and nice, were depicted uncritically. This, again, perhaps owes to the attitudes of the time, but robs it of some historical accuracy or value in the modern day.\n",

As that? A purely thrilling pulp story? Sure! It's pretty good! Well-structured and occasionally exciting! And capably written! But is that enough to have it be regarded as a classic work of fiction and taught to every North American child in elementary school? Probably not.\n",

However, I could’ve done without Buck’s visions of the past. Also, I’m not sure what I’m supposed to make of Buck’s wildness. He essentially becomes a killing machine (violence being the only way London really indicates wildness), but the book also establishes Buck’s domestic relationship with John Thornton as the central happiness of the dog’s life. Is Buck’s wildness preferable because it’s “natural”? Or is Buck’s wildness tragic?\n",

At times I feel that London is one with the animal instinct, and the call of the wild. Mostly though, I don't really feel like this is written from the perspective of the dog - it's probably hard to keep that up for a whole book, though I feel like that is the premise. Also, the animal cruelty was tough to read about.

He becomes part of a sled dog team and struggles to learn the ins and outs of sledding life, including dealing with the other pack dogs.

Since his plight is that of what hundreds of dogs had in real life during the gold rush, it's easy to see how his story has an element of truth in it. I also like how we almost get to see his emotions directly through the telling of this story because you can see the way his thoughts and actions changed and how he adapted. And you really can empathize with him, even though he's a dog. The different people in the book were interesting too, although it's Buck's beloved owner John Thornton that truly steals my heart with his treatment of Buck. The chapters with him in it are some of my favorites. That's not saying the other characters didn't have their place, but he was one that stood out.\n",

It never even occured to me that there were dogs other than huskies doing the work. I also thought that the book was perfectly paced. Since it's technically a kid's book it's shorter than most books, but it's done in such a great way that you become so involved in the book and lose track of time. However, one thing to note considering that this is a kid's book is that there is a great deal of violence and graphic description of fights, killings, etc. For those sensitive hearts that love animals and can't handle one in pain, this isn't a book that should probably be read.\n",

Afterwards, Buck is sold to a set of French-Canadian dispatchers and then taken to the Klondike region of Canada. In there, the protagonist dog is trained as a sled dog.

      "The first thing I noticed was how brutal and explicitly everything was described. It is a story of animal use and abuse, of growing up/coming of age/coming into one's own, and of the harsh conditions the animals and humans endured in the north. However, there is absolutely no subtlety, no poetry of word, no glimmer or shine of anything amongst the bleak, dark, ruthless, bruising, cutting, and frozen crunch of the words that are written. Equally blunt a weapon are the words used to describe every single conclusion that Buck comes to about the other dogs, or \"comrades\", and human nature in the North vs. California. There is no room for nuance, interpretation or readers coming to independent conclusions.\n",

      "The second thing I noticed in this reading is the prevalence of the male version of the Mary Sue literary trope, sometimes called Marty Stu (or Gary Stu or Larry Stu). This trope was originally named in 1973 for a fanfiction female character who is unexpectedly good at all things for no comprehensible reason. A Mary Sue character is almost always seen as a feature of bad writing, yet those same critics don't realize how often and how long Marty Stu characters have been thriving in popular writing and movies for centuries. There is no explicable reason that Buck, a mix of two domesticated breeds, should be better than any other dog he meets on his journeys in fighting, cunning, problem-solving, instinct and survival. Why would Buck have this magical ability to hear the call of the wild over the huskies and other partial breeds Buck met? Why would Buck have more strength and temerity?\n",

I think I had some pre-conceived notions about this book that didn't come into fruition. It was a fun and adventurous story, but I think I just wanted to feel more involved as the reader. \n",
