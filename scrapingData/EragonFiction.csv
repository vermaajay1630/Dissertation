Maybe for readers who read fantasy books for a long time, the story of a boy from the town of Carvahall is nothing special, but for me it turned out to be a door to a wonderful world.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,3.0," I read this book when I was in middle school, and decided to re-read it before Murtagh comes out in a few months. It was a great read for the nostalgia! I forgot so many things that happened, it was almost like reading it for the first time. 
 The plot of this book is great; there is never a dull moment. The world is also very engaging (it helps that the characters traverse a large span of the land over the course of the book). 
 The characters in this book are great. I loved Brom, though the man kept so many secrets it was hard to not resent him sometimes like Eragon did. Saphira was a fascinating character as well, and balanced out Eragon’s rash impulses (when she was able to, at least). Murtagh is perhaps the most intriguing character of all, and I am very curious as to how his story will play out. I am also curious as to Arya’s history. It certainly sounds like we will explore that in the next book. 
 Though I loved this book in middle school (and still enjoyed reading it now!), the writing did not feel very engaging to me. It was written as if Eragon was an old man and recounting his adventures to a scribe. This can be done really well, but it fell a little flat for me on this re-read. So many of the sentences were so basic and factual with no additional emotional or descriptive details. This isn’t to say there were no descriptive passages, because there definitely were! This is just to say the descriptiveness could have been more consistent throughout. 
 The last thing I will say (and I felt this way when I read it at 15) is, what a feat for a fifteen-year-old to write such an extensive story! This may have been why I felt the writing lacked descriptive consistency — I certainly wasn’t writing with exceptional quality when I was fifteen — but the plot is particularly strong for an author so young. The character of Eragon was also done particularly well. All of his rash decisions do make sense for Eragon being so young, and I think the fact the author was writing from that age himself gives that a genuine touch that may have been lacking otherwise.  
 If you read this as a teenager when it first came out, I highly recommend for the nostalgia! Looking forward to continuing Eragon’s journey in the rest of the series.

The farm boy tries going back home after hearing that members of an evil empire are after him, but *surprise-surprise* the evil empire bad guys were already there and had killed everyone and burned the place to the ground.
However, after that, the plot turns onto a more original plot path, and I found myself getting deeply attached to the story. My favorite evil villain in the whole book was the ""shade"".

This has all the components of a well-researched and well-written fantasy book. You got magic abilities, prophecies, magical creatures, father figures who die, bloody revenge, secret dreams, fight sequences, and of course--my favorite--dwarves.

But what makes this particular book (and I hope the rest of the series) not just another magic fantasy series is the complex but holistic world building, magic functions that actually make sense with no plot holes (looking at you, JKR), and the depth of the characters. Sure, there are some Professionally Evil characters, but most of the named characters are complex, with both ""good"" and ""evil"" thoughts, behaviors, and motivations. Nothing I have read has come close to the complexities of characters in The Witcher, but damn this one has all the right makings.

I appreciate the way Paolini writes his battle scenes. I was nervous when I learned a 19 year old boy was the author of these books, so I assumed the battle scenes would be long, unnecessarily bloody, and contain a different deus ex machina each time.

WRONG

I think I would say Eragon is a decent enough starting point. And honestly, I’m pretty sure it might be one of the first fantasy stories that I read myself in Middle School. And with the recent announcement of a TV Show adaption of Eragon happening, I decided I would try rereading the book. Now many years past when I originally read it, and with a much better understanding of the fantasy genre and reading in general. Why not give it another shot, and see how it actually holds up after all this time.

So what are my honest thoughts about Eragon? It is kinda a fan-fiction of Lord of the Rings. Right from the very first chapter, you are immediately confronted with creatures and monsters and a world that you have trouble not seeing as their Lord of the Rings counterparts. Reading through the book, I never once thought anything in it was all that original. You could very easily see what other media the Author Chris Paolini used to craft the story and the characters and the world.

And yet as you finish up the first book, I can’t say I didn’t walk away enjoying what I read. It isn’t perfect in any aspect, not even close. The story progression is honestly rather uneven, with the beginning being a very strong start but it starts to fall apart some the longer it goes. Events start to happen simply cause they are required, not because they are well foreshadowed. And the final battle in the story feels so very rushed, it never had enough time to develop and instead just kinda happens suddenly and is over just as fast. Honestly you get the feeling it exists simply because Paolini thought every book requires some big action piece to end the book, and that he couldn’t simple end the book on some mystic and wonder to entice readers to return for the second book.

The characters aren’t the worst you have ever read, but also never impress. Much like everything else in the story, they are just fine. Though they suffer from making dumb choices at times that feels out of character simply to move the story in the required direction. There are also some hints of a future romance, though I will leave any discussion of that for when I read the next book.

I guess the real question is, would I recommend reading the Eragon? And I think I would have to say yea, go right ahead and read it. But don’t expect a masterful fantasy novel, or something deep and thought provoking. It is none of those things. It is a pretty standard Fantasy Novel that is based closely on Lord of the Rings. That is simple enough for a young new reader to enjoy, with enough action and fast enough pace to keep the reader entertained. Just don’t look too deep, or you will find all the issues the book has.",ask name random young adult fantasy story story would point decent starting point middle school kid get fantasy think would say eragon decent enough starting point honestly pretty sure might one first fantasy stories read middle school recent announcement tv show adaption eragon happening decided would try rereading book many years past originally read much better understanding fantasy genre reading general give another shot see actually holds time honest thoughts eragon kinda lord rings right first chapter immediately confronted creatures monsters world trouble seeing lord rings counterparts reading book never thought anything original could easily see media author chris paolini used craft story characters world yet finish first book say walk away enjoying read perfect aspect even close story progression honestly rather uneven beginning strong start starts fall apart longer goes events start happen simply cause required well foreshadowed final battle story feels rushed never enough time develop instead kinda happens suddenly fast honestly get feeling exists simply paolini thought every book requires big action piece end book simple end book mystic wonder entice readers return second book characters worst ever read also never impress much like everything else story fine though suffer making dumb choices times feels character simply move story required direction also hints future romance though leave discussion read next book guess real question would recommend reading eragon think would say yea go right ahead read expect masterful fantasy novel something deep thought provoking none things pretty standard fantasy novel based closely lord rings simple enough young new reader enjoy enough action fast enough pace keep reader entertained look deep find issues book,True,Positive,Positive

Paolini is a master of his craft, creating such a beautiful world and intricate characters. I know a lot of people find Eragon annoying and immature....he's 15 and 16 in this book, it's expected for him to be so! It makes him realistic in circumstances that are so fantastical, which I really appreciate in a good character. But we also see him grow a lot in his maturity, not just in the series but just in this first book. I love how Paolini develops his characters, including Eragon. 

And the world....few authors have captured by heart and dreams the way Paolini has with Alagaesia. The lore and history and magic and landscapes and just all of it is stunning and has had my mind in a chokehold for over a decade. I find something new every time I read Eragon which is a testament to the quality of the writing, in my opinion.

Is it a perfect book? No. Is it wonderful all the same? Yes. The storytelling is masterful, the characters real, and the world building/lore/magic intricate, the plot captivating.

When reading a book with your eyes, it's up to you what the characters sound like speaking to each other. I experienced with this audiobook that my impressions of the various characters and their dynamics was different than how the voice actor interpreted them. In the audiobook version, Eragon sounds more whiney and not at all like the moody teenager I imagined him sounding like. I was also completely thrown off by the voice actor giving Eragon a ""British"" sounding accent and Murtagh an ""Irish"" sounding accent. Additionally, I had imagined Saphirra having a more womanly, elegant, and sassy sounding voice since she doesn't speak with her vocal folds but with her mind, so I was surprised when the voice actor made her voice gravelly because she's a dragon. It definitely took away from the prosody of her voice to have to maintain that gruffness. The voice actor also pronounced some made up words/names of places differently than I remember thinking they would be pronounced.

It is very much those. I'm seeing parts of Eragon copied from everywhere: Star Wars, Tolkien; I even see hints of Lewis in the plot! My guess is that Paolini loved fantasy and writing so much he decided to write his own fantasy book inspired by his favorite stories. But it's not plagiarism. Decide for yourself whether it's too redundant to be worth reading (and I could definitely see calling it redundant), but ""plagiarism"" is a little far.

Characters: Murtagh was amazing. The rest of the main characters (save Brom occasionally) did not capture my interest. Saphira was treated as a plot element, not a character, and was used mainly for exposition.

I'm not mad about the familiarity of the plot. But the purple prose drove me completely insane. Paolini's story consists of sentences which are made up of fancy words, meaningless metaphors, good-sounding but bad similes, pure nonsense, and somewhere hidden beneath all of the lace and tinsel is the normal sentence, which is fine. All he needs is that sentence. None of this useless lace! We don't need that! Trim it, Paolini! TRIM IT!

It is long, tedious, time-wasting, and ends in loose ends and unfinished character development. Unless you would like to talk about how terrible it is, I see no reason to waste your time plowing through unnecessary chapters that add nothing to the story just so you can see what happens (or more correctly DOESN'T HAPPEN) to the characters we've been reading about for four gigantic needed-to-be-edited books.

The best things about this book and the rest of the series:


It's nice and long, so you know that you can sit back and relax.

The character's are likeable.

It has some funny parts.

It has a little bit of everything; romance, humor, adventure, battles...

It's one of those good, old fashioned good-guys-fighting-the-evil-emperor books.

It's interestingly written


The worst things about this book:


Although each part is not really long, each part has a very small, boring, or needless thing in it so that the end result is a book with about one-fifth of it needless droning. There is a lot of polite talking that I'm sure could have been trimmed here.

It's predictable; who's in love with who, who is on which side, who will come back, all that stuff.

As the character's travel around in this series, it becomes tedious. We're now getting bogged down by which way to go, how long it will take, and other decisions that the author takes care of in other books. Sure, it might be more realistic, but sometimes you just want to read without having to think of all their problems.

Dilemmas that occur a long time ago are still in motion or mentioned pages of even books later.

We keep revisiting the same places.

We have to cope with ever problem, moral or other, watch them sort it out, and then watch them conclude and move on to the next one.

There are countless battle scenes that are pretty much all the same. It's like Paolini's trying to think up how many different, gruesome ways he can come up with to say that someone was killed. These battle scenes drone on and on and on, and when the book is over I think of those parts not as interesting scenes but as needles gray space.

Things take a very long time to happen. (Drumming-your-fingers-when-you-think-about-it-later long.)

Teenage-level violence is mixed in with juvenile plot twists; you can't win.

The writing is correctly punctuated and all that, but Paolini has a habit of inserting semi-difficult words to express normal things. It seems like an effort to show off these cool words or to make the book seem more adult. It just comes off as sort of snobby and mostly annoying and hard to understand.

The end result when I'm done with one of these is to think of it as: long, entertaining, a bit gruesome, a bit tedious, funny, adventurous, and overall pretty enjoyable.


Though this long list of negatives about the series seems controversial to my four-star rating, most of those were things that I realized later, not when reading. The reading part is more enjoyable.

Not for little kids.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.0,"Eragon made a huge splash when Knopf published it to a wider audience in 2003. It seemed to be the fantasy book to read and talk about if you were a teenager or YA reader or a fantasy enthusiast at the time. Paolini was heralded as a new fantasy wunderkind, with a book as electrifying and exciting as Harry Potter or any other mega blockbuster out there. Indeed, it was even turned into a pretty bland blockbuster in 2006, and several best-selling sequels that made Paolini a celebrated YA author.

In many respects, Paolini deserves some of the accolades he's received for Eragon. The book shows a surprising bit of sophistication for a novel penned while the author was still in his teens. The prose occasionally rises to a higher occasion than its YA roots, and there's virtually no end to what Paolini wanted to explore in building a world of fantasy.

But beneath occasionally inspired prose and the one or two decent character moments between the book's protagonist and his mentor, the novel remains flooded with structural problems that make the reading a bit of a drag for more mature readers. As many have noted, Paolini's work is highly derivative of greater franchises such as The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars (honestly, the whole book feels like you may as well change Eragon's name to Luke Skywalker) and it definitely steals more than just one idea from older medieval classics (the dwarf king named Hrothgar is a dead giveaway). Nevertheless, these sources of inspiration could be excused if the plot felt tighter and the characters of the novel served greater purpose than to just save Eragon at every turn.

Character development especially feels like one of Eragon's greatest issues, as Paolini's freshman approach to writing characters boils down exclusively to how much exposition they can unload while speaking to Eragon. Virtually every secondary character, from Brom to Orik, serves a singular purpose of guiding the reader to the expansive lore of Paolini's fictional world. Eragon, who is dumb as a box of rocks from beginning to end, has to have virtually every little bit of the world explained to him, and the exposition doesn't stop ever. Even in the concluding pages of the story, Eragon is still having to have things explained to him.

Plot structure is also one of the novel's greater weaknesses. Paolini takes Eragon literally all over his fictional map, and while the story could be said to be broken up into a few distinct ""episodes,"" it doesn't really seem to have much by way of functional climax and denouement. The whole beginning of the book is spent with Eragon on a revenge mission, which never comes to anything close to a conclusion. Suddenly, the book changes course to a rescue mission, then a concluding battle against an antagonist for whom it is difficult to feel any real animosity, given that he barely shows up in the novel for more than two other passages. There's little sense of stakes or even motivations for conflict; things just happen because it feels like the book needs some action to break up the exposition.

Paolini also commits some pretty egregious literary sins repeatedly throughout the novel. He has a bit of really, really bad poetry, some pretty nonsensical metaphors and similes, and his protagonist (and narrator) gets pretty inappropriately horny at times. Moreover, Paolini relies heavily on knocking out his protagonist any time he writes himself into a corner with regards to building tension for the plot. As a result, readers can expect Paolini to fade to black just about every twenty pages (that's really not exaggeration).

Despite the story being a meandering and often meaningless mess, and despite the characters being flat and exceedingly one-dimensional archetypes, there's still a glimmer of hope for Paolini and for the continuing Inheritance Cycle. It's hard to find fault in what amounts to an apprentice effort, and while I do hope Paolini's craft improves in the later novels, I can see the glimmer of promise in this novice effort.",eragon made huge splash knopf published wider audience seemed fantasy book read talk teenager ya reader fantasy enthusiast time paolini heralded new fantasy wunderkind book electrifying exciting harry potter mega blockbuster indeed even turned pretty bland blockbuster several sequels made paolini celebrated ya author many respects paolini deserves accolades received eragon book shows surprising bit sophistication novel penned author still teens prose occasionally rises higher occasion ya roots virtually end paolini wanted explore building world fantasy beneath occasionally inspired prose one two decent character moments book protagonist mentor novel remains flooded structural problems make reading bit drag mature readers many noted paolini work highly derivative greater franchises lord rings star wars honestly whole book feels like may well change eragon name luke skywalker definitely steals one idea older medieval classics dwarf king named hrothgar dead giveaway nevertheless sources inspiration could excused plot felt tighter characters novel served greater purpose save eragon every turn character development especially feels like one eragon greatest issues paolini freshman approach writing characters boils exclusively much exposition unload speaking eragon virtually every secondary character brom orik serves singular purpose guiding reader expansive lore paolini fictional world eragon dumb box rocks beginning end virtually every little bit world explained exposition stop ever even concluding pages story eragon still things explained plot structure also one novel greater weaknesses paolini takes eragon literally fictional map story could said broken distinct episodes really seem much way functional climax denouement whole beginning book spent eragon revenge mission never comes anything close conclusion suddenly book changes course rescue mission concluding battle antagonist difficult feel real animosity given barely shows novel two passages little sense stakes even motivations conflict things happen feels like book needs action break exposition paolini also commits pretty egregious literary sins repeatedly throughout novel bit really really bad poetry pretty nonsensical metaphors similes protagonist narrator gets pretty inappropriately horny times moreover paolini relies heavily knocking protagonist time writes corner regards building tension plot result readers expect paolini fade black every twenty pages really exaggeration despite story meandering often meaningless mess despite characters flat exceedingly archetypes still glimmer hope paolini continuing inheritance cycle hard find fault amounts apprentice effort hope paolini craft improves later novels see glimmer promise novice effort,True,Positive,Positive

Maybe it’s because I love this kind of plot (the Chosen One, Dragons, magic, heroism) and this book has all of it.

I loved Saphira and Eragon’s relationship. I’m really eager to see how it will develop in the next books. I also liked his friendship with Murtagh. I only hope that Murtagh’s character is more developed in the next books.

The author focuses on event details, like when getting dragon armor eragon asks ""What do you think?"" Saphira resonds ""Let;s try it on."" then 'After a good deal of struggling, Eragon and Orik step back to admire the results.' (with a long describtion of the armor on Saphira)... It's fine, but indicative of the writing lacking depth. Meetings will happen, plot details will be shared and then the other person will suddenly be busy, unwilling to discuss any other perhaps relavent details, or answer questions both Eragon and the reader have. Kinda feels like an underwritten videogame.
Characters are fine, with motivations, but incredibly shallow/one dimensional - something I did not remember from this work, and hope to see better of in the sequel.
Plot is fine, taking from star wars is not a blow against this book, and it does do a good job of setting up questions and plotlines that I want to read about.

I’m pretty critical of fantasy on the whole. I find it to be quite repetitive and follow similar story points and tropes. My hope in reading any fantasy is that is has something that’s unique unto itself to at least break up that monotony. And I thought Eragon did that well.

It was more focused than most fantasy I read. Everything that happened seemed like it had a purpose. Even typical side quests at least served the main mission in some capacity instead of it being some pointless respite on the walking/riding mission (which was truncated in this book in general, as they got to places very quickly) to showcase some nifty thing I don’t care about. It was centered around Eragon completely, which was mostly a gift, and led to the focus I enjoyed a lot.

Eragon was a good character. He had flaws that were helped along by Brom (who I was sad to see die). Petty and almost childish grumblings aside, I did enjoy Eragon and Saphira’s relationship a good bit, although I’m hoping the dragon becomes a bigger fixture in the forthcoming books. Brom was probably my favorite character: he was stoic and mysterious and was really the anchor of the first half. Murtaugh was complex as well and I’m hoping, alongside Saphira, I see more of.

I enjoyed the story a good bit. It was typical to fantasy, but I thought they spent a splendid amount of time in the “shire” (which is one of my other problems with most fantasy; the shire is some of the more fascinating stuff and they usually blow by it). I also liked the serious internal dialogues about life that Eragon faced; it was unexpected and endeared me to his arc. Plus, the ending had some nice mystery and makes me excited to get back into soon.

This just felt toned down in a lot of ways and I appreciated that. Page length, travel, story, everything felt really solid and important.

A great fantasy story with all the fantasy elements I love - magic, dragons, elves, propechy, magical objects and supernatural creatures.
Eragon is a story with action right from the start and continues for the rest of the story, there is a good balance between calm and actionpacked scenes. The flow in the story is well written with some great plottwists sprinkled throughout the story. Despite all the things that were happening, the story never felt rushed.
The story is filled with fairytale-like descriptions, and it works well with the story. The descriptions really created an epic fantasy world, that I enjoyed learning about.
I liked all the different characters in the story, each had their own personality that were well written. The development Eragon go through in the story was written realictically, believable and at the right moments.
There is a bit of romance in the book, but it does not take up a lot space.

The writing is undoubtedly gorgeous at times… but almost to its detriment?

Paolini does such a good job of world building and yet the pace of this book is utterly monotonous. Pages will be spent describing things and while the language may be perfectly good, it fails to capture your attention for that long. Likewise, the plot crawls along at a snail’s pace too. Following the journey sometimes feels incredibly realistic but only in the sense that you feel like you spent just as much time as the characters did in their journey.

The characters are acceptable. The most intriguing character is the dragon herself and even she can be obnoxious at times.

Ultimately, there were several times when I wanted to give up on this book and move on to something else but decided not to. The ending was satisfactory but not spectacular.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,5.0,"In 2002 I was 16 and a sophomore in high school. I was the Manhattan finalist for a storytelling festival. I was writing, mostly poetry. The year before I had been named runner up in a contest held by the Poetry Society of America and had the poem I entered read on the radio. I used to feel pretty good about those accomplishments until I read Christopher Paolini's bio on his first book.

In 2002 Christopher Paolini was 15 and a high school graduate. So, of course, the next obvious step was to write a novel. Which is why readers now have Eragon, the latest in a long line of dragon-centric fantasies (I just made that term up). This novel is the first in the Inheritance Trilogy (Eldest is already out and Brisingr is due for release soon). It was also made into a movie in 2006 that I enjoyed quite a bit even before I found its excellent tagline: ""You are stronger than you realize. Wiser than you know. What was once your life is now your legend.""

The reason I mention the movie at all is because this is one of the only books I can think of where I saw the movie adaptation before I read the book. I really liked both and found it interesting to be motivated to read a book because of the movie. Before I review the book I just want to get this out of my system: Eragon was really good and I enjoyed it, but it did at times sound like it was written by a fifteen-year-old. I'm not saying that to be petty or because of sour grapes--I just really think that's the case.

In addition to mentioning his age, Paolini's back flap bio mentions that he has an abiding love of fantasy that subsequently motivated him to write his own fantasy novel. For that reason, Eragon owes an obvious debt to some of the fantasy big shots. Like Tamora Pierce's books (and Gail Carson Levine's), this one has a medieval-esque setting. The most obvious similarities that I noticed lie between this book and Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books (and The Hobbit too). Obviously, then, if you like those books you will like Eragon. At the same time, though, these similarities did leave me wishing there were more ""acceptable"" ways to write a fantasy setting. Maybe that's me.

More than an event book where events are central to the plot and the story moves from event to event, this is a journey book. Stuff happens, but most of the novel is spent traveling. In a sense, the entire book is a journey to the end which I assume leads to more revelations which will be found in the second book in the trilogy.

The book's journey starts with its title character, Eragon, a fifteen-year-old youth living in a rural town in the land of Alagaesia. Once a place of glory where dragons and their riders kept peace across the country, the Empire is now ruled by a cruel king called Galbatorix. Such concerns are far from Eragon's daily concerns though. Living with his uncle and cousin, Eragon's days are spent helping his family farm their land and prepare for winter.

All of that changes when Eragon returns from a hunting trip with a mysterious stone. Soon enough, he realizes the stone is actually an egg. A dragon egg. The presence of this new dragon will not only change the course of Eragon's life but also the path of the entire Empire. Thus Eragon is set on a new path with only his dragon, an old storyteller and a mysterious sword to help him find his way.

And that, really, is what this book is about: Eragon finding his way as he learns what being a Rider, and dare I say being a hero, really means. One of the subtler things I liked about the writing is that when Paolini begins this story, his protagonist is clearly a boy even if by Alagaesian standards he's only a year from manhood. By the end of the novel, though, Eragon is a man. The writing changes subtly to reflect this important change from beginning to end.

Eragon is literally finding his way too--the novel features a lot of long, perilous journeys and long, dangerous battles. All of which were good to read but did leave me burnt out when I finally made my way to the end of my paperback copy (on page 497). Sometimes it's just surprising how long it can take to read a long book.

For fear of providing accidental spoilers, that's really all I have to say. Once I got over the fact that I did not graduate high school at fifteen or write a novel, the book was not at all depressing. Eragon features some great characters (Brom to name one) and some of the scariest villains seen in recent fantasies. I have high hopes for the next installment in the trilogy once I get my hands on it.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,3.5,"I’ve already reviewed this book once, along with the second one by Paolini in this series. And I’ll admit I wasn’t pleased when we found my review had been deleted and if I wanted a review on my site, I’d have to read them again.

I’ve been a bit lost as to how to review this. Granted, it’s a great piece of work for someone who is 15. The ability to come up with a plot that will cover four full-length novels is impressive for any age. Yet, my first review was nothing less than scathing due to the lack of inventiveness on Paolini’s part. Interesting dichotomy of feelings going on, to say the least.

First, the good. This is a great story for someone who is just entering the fantasy field of literature to read. The plot isn’t too hard to follow, and moves quickly enough to keep the interest of a pre-teen or early teenager who hasn’t been immersed in the world of fantasy fiction. Saphira as a character is charming and wonderful. There are enough changes in venue and battles to keep a young reader involved, some good passages of description, and hints at what is to come in the plots of the next three books. You’re left wondering what’s coming in the next passage and at times it’s hard to stop reading.

Unfortunately, this shallow set-up plot comes from Paolini drawing from many, *many*, other sources of science-fiction and fantasy. There are blatant elements from Star Wars, Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings Series, Ursula K. LeGuin’s Earthsea, and many others. Frequent readers in these two families of literature may (some have expressed, including myself) find themselves disgusted with the lack of inventiveness on Paolini’s part. Sure, this is a great fictional story and set up for following books, but it’s great because it draws on so many great archetypes and classics from the genres. What separates Paolini’s work from these classics is that the classics have taken the archetypes found in all literature and put a twist on them which makes them their own…Paolini fails to do this. Instead he creates a mishmash of icons from all his favorite stories and uses them to create his own. There is nothing original (as of yet) to set this series apart as something special in the Fantasy genre which will keep it from being a thing-of-the-week.

The other downfall of Paolini is his word choice. He writes something that only those who have no background in fantasy genres are going to completely appreciate and embrace, only he uses words which most American children and pre-teens are not going to recognize. The best way to get your point across is to write simplistically and Paolini is frankly, too pretentious to be able to communicate easily with his young readers. He writes for adults, and well-read adults, without being able to fabricate a plot original enough to appeal to them. The two sides of the novel are not reconciled to each other and in order to gain this reader’s respect, Paolini will have to mature a great deal in his third and fourth books.",already reviewed book along second one paolini series admit pleased found review deleted wanted review site read bit lost review granted great piece work someone ability come plot cover four novels impressive age yet first review nothing less scathing due lack inventiveness paolini part interesting dichotomy feelings going say least first good great story someone entering fantasy field literature read plot hard follow moves quickly enough keep interest early teenager immersed world fantasy fiction saphira character charming wonderful enough changes venue battles keep young reader involved good passages description hints come plots next three books left wondering coming next passage times hard stop reading unfortunately shallow plot comes paolini drawing many many sources fantasy blatant elements star wars tolkien lord rings series ursula leguin earthsea many others frequent readers two families literature may expressed including find disgusted lack inventiveness paolini part sure great fictional story set following books great draws many great archetypes classics genres separates paolini work classics classics taken archetypes found literature put twist makes fails instead creates mishmash icons favorite stories uses create nothing original yet set series apart something special fantasy genre keep downfall paolini word choice writes something background fantasy genres going completely appreciate embrace uses words american children going recognize best way get point across write simplistically paolini frankly pretentious able communicate easily young readers writes adults adults without able fabricate plot original enough appeal two sides novel reconciled order gain reader respect paolini mature great deal third fourth books,True,Positive,Positive

Years later a boy named Eragon finds one of the last remaining dragon eggs. It hatches, and he becomes the first dragon rider in an age. Now he must decide where his loyalties lie and train to be able to take on the massive responsibility thrust upon him.

This is the book that really started my love of dragons. I adore the magic system and dragon/rider relationship. The characters are relatable and lovable but still flawed. I feel like this story is very good for young readers or those who are new to fantasy. It has all the elements of classic high fantasy but we explore the story through the eyes of someone who completely lacks knowledge of the magic within his world. Because of this, the explanations are thorough (without being tedious) and the information is explained in digestible bits and pieces.

I will say that Paolini does sometimes fall into the trap of over explaining/describing things. I applaud him for how vivid his characters and setting appear in my mind, but could honestly go without a few details for the sake of pacing.

Okay, not really the end of the story. Eragon is, as others have said, completely unoriginal and not exactly well-written. It might as well be set in the same Middle Earth as LOTR- I can't speak for the similarities to the Star Wars plotline because I've never read Star Wars.

The character of Murtagh - one of the most interesting seemed to be pushed aside and not really dealt with (whether this is due to his decision or that he is further explored in the other books, I'm yet to find out).

But I finally did it.

I did enjoy Eragon to start off with in 2012, I read about halfway, then a really exciting book would come out and I would just forget about it. For the next 2 years I would pick it up occasionally and read a chapter or two. Then came the desert. I don't even remember what desert it was. All I remember was that it took fifty-freakin-pages. Do you know what fills 50 pages of desert? Sand; and that's about it.
It was the most boring part of the book ever, and I could not even get past a page when I tried to pick it up. Then the once blue-lined pages became grey from sitting on my bedside table next to the sun for so long until I decided - this book was not going to be read.
Then, I got a boyfriend. And conveniently Eragon was his favorite book...OF ALL TIME. I couldn't believe it. The only book that I had stopped reading 60% of the way through and kept on my bedside table as a freakin ornament, was the book I would hear praise about for the next 2 years. I still couldn't pick it up.

Then I started ""The Book Jar"". The ""Never Too Young for YA & NA Books"" group on Goodreads started this challenge where you add titles that you have been meaning to read for ages but never got around to into a jar and pick out randomly. Remember that word.
Well, I made the mistake to let my bf pick out a random book from my book jar with 40+ book titles in it, while I was in the shower. Guess what book he conveniently picked out.

And I freakin love him for it.
I picked up this book (still at the 60% mark) in a completely new light; expecting something terrible- and getting the best. I was thrilled at the action and always telling myself ""just one more chapter..."" I couldn't believe it- I was liking Eragon. Of course, I did enjoy this book before the dreaded Desert scene. But not like this. This was incredible. And I almost want to pick up the next book.... almost. I still struggled to remember bits of what happened in the first half, but then again my Eragon-obsessed-boyfriend, couldn't really tell me much either.

So I enjoyed it, sorry for the long story but I'm so astounded that I finished this book after a four-year attempt. Thanks ""Never Too Young for YA & NA Books"" & *cough* My boyfriend; you made me achieve the impossible.

Re-reading a childhood favorite: Eragon. 

I remember first finding out about this book through a book fair at school. A book about dragons, written by a young author who was roughly the same age I was when he first wrote it, and as an aspiring writer it immediately caught my eye. Needless to say, it has been 20 years since then and phew… I was wondering what I would think about it now if I reread it. 

A classic fantasy trope, a coming of age story, a young poor farmer boy thrust into a world much bigger than what he thinks and an age old conflict involving tyranny, magic and of course dragons. The characters are still quite likable to me, but your mileage may vary. Eragon’s impulsive and rash decisions is something I still enjoyed, because it does feel like how a teenager would react. I always appreciate how many of his rash decisions have consequences and something that I think a lot of YA protagonists don’t go through as often. Saphira’s shifts from wise responses to sassy remarks are always a joy and the sibling-like bond she has with Eragon is still one of my favorite relationships in this book. I enjoy the magic system, how it operates and the consequences of using it. There is not much character development just yet, but I do like the pace in which the combat advances, it doesn’t feel overly rushed which is something I think a lot of other YA books suffer from.

There is ONE scene that bothered me because it felt like a massive plot hole. I could handwave some things but one in particular just.. Took me out. Does it matter that much in the grand scheme of things? Eh, not really. It just bugged me and wished it had happened differently. (Page 403 for those curious since I am trying to keep this spoiler free.) 

I don't think the writing has aged poorly but it does suffer in certain parts. Some descriptions are confusing or overly embellished, some word choices felt unnecessary. There are a handful of combat scenes where it’s difficult to follow what exactly is happening because of the way that they’re described. It does not bother me too much personally, and if I recall correctly, the writing does improve throughout the series which is to be expected.

Did I still enjoy it? Absolutely. Still love the characters. There were scenes that made me chuckle alongside scenes that gripped at my heart. Is it fueled by nostalgia of how I felt when I first read through it? Perhaps. But there’s something special about the way Eragon and Saphira’s bond is written that I will always love.

The book is fast paced from the start and I find Poalini's style very readable.

The book follows a few short months of Eragon's life starting when he discovers a strange stone whilst hunting in the woods, which turns out to be a dragon egg. The egg hatches and Eragon becomes a new age Rider.

Not long after Eragon becomes a rider his uncle is brutally murdered by creatures that work for the king who are searching for the egg. Enraged Eragon goes after the creatures wanting revenge.

Eragon's travels take him all over Alagaesia and leave him on the run from the king who wants to use him for evil. The only place he can turn is to the Varden, who openly opose the King.

On his way to the Varden, Eragon loses a close friend and rescues an elf from the clutches if the Empire.

The novel ends with a huge battle under the Beor Mountain Range where the Varden are in hiding. The battle, along with the novel, ends with tragedy and makes me want to pick up the sequel everytime.

While I won't go into how heavily this book borrows from other fantasies, I will go into some of its other flaws. That's not to say that because it has flaws it isn't worth reading, however. It proves to be good mind candy and a great way to settle down on a rainy day.

Eragon is a poor farm boy who's out hunting when he finds a dragon egg. Not sure of what it is at first, he attempts to sell it. Being unable to sell it he keeps it and is very surprised when out hatches a dragon. He keeps her in secret as the empire would destroy him and his family if they knew they possessed a dragon. But somehow, they find out and Eragon narrowly escapes with Brown (a mysterious bard in the town)and Saphira (the dragon). He swears revenge on his Uncle's killers and he, Brom, and Saphira (although they meet other friends along the way)take off across the country in pursuit of them. But there are more dangers than that and he finds himself wondering if the Varden (a rebel group) can assist him and Saphira with their revenge.

The characters are ok. There are a wide variety of characters, but what I find a problem with is authenticity. Eragon is supposed to be a poor uneducated, illiterate farm boy, yet he speaks like one with higher learning, possibly surpassing normal noble speech as well. The way he speaks just doesn't ring true for his character.

The writing is VERY descriptive and flowery. This isn't always a bad thing, but it does bog the story down a bit and as mentioned before, makes the character's speech hard to take. The dialogues in the book are also very stilted and unnatural. Otherwise, the story as a whole is pretty unoffensive and appropriate for younger readers despite having battle scenes.

I read this series for fun, not because I'm searching for some amazing piece of fantasy. And that's the way I think this book should have to be taken otherwise you could drive yourself nuts reading it.

It would've been interesting to see how I felt about this book if I had read it as a kid/teenager than now as a 30 year old woman. After having read quite a few fantasies, I definitely understand the criticism around this book. It's nothing new, it's not difficult, it's not particularly fascinating, and it feels very cookie-cutter BUT that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy myself. I think this is a great intro book for kids/teens into fantasy if they've never read one before. I've always found LOTR a bit too intense for me and trying to read it as a kid I felt very silly and like I should be able to understand it more than I did, so I think this is a good way for kids to get involved in the genre.

That being said, you can definitely tell in the beginning that it's written by a teenager, the choice of words feel a bit silly and it all feels a bit ""I am a fantasy book, here are all the words we use to make sure you know it's fantasy"" and that felt a bit cringe to me. With that being said, it's literally a teenager writing this, you can only take that criticism so far. I think after about 30% I felt that silliness of it go away and it seemed like Paolini really landed on his writing skills.

I bounced back and forth on this between ebook and audio and I think I did prefer it on ebook. I really disliked the voicing of Saphira and it always took me out of the story for some reason. For the actual characters, they were just okay. Eragon was a run-of-the-mill kid turned hero and Brom was the wise old mentor. Nothing new is being told here, I particularly didn't care much for the portrayal of Arya and how little we got to see of her. No moments were particularly shocking and is it just me or did all this time I think Eragon was the dragon, lol.

Overall, a fine book, I'm glad that I can finally say I read it. I won't continue with the series, but I understand why everyone loved it. Can't wait to watch the horrible movie.",would interesting see felt book read year old woman read quite fantasies definitely understand criticism around book nothing new difficult particularly fascinating feels mean enjoy think great intro book fantasy never read one always found lotr bit intense trying read kid felt silly like able understand think good way kids get involved genre said definitely tell beginning written teenager choice words feel bit silly feels bit fantasy book words use make sure know fantasy felt bit cringe said literally teenager writing take criticism far think felt silliness go away seemed like paolini really landed writing skills bounced back forth ebook audio think prefer ebook really disliked voicing saphira always took story reason actual characters okay eragon kid turned hero brom wise old mentor nothing new told particularly care much portrayal arya little got see moments particularly shocking time think eragon dragon lol overall fine book glad finally say read wo continue series understand everyone loved ca wait watch horrible movie,True,Positive,Positive

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.0,"I first read Eragon when I was 15 or so. At that time of my life, I had not read the amount of fantasy books I have today and gobbled up Eragon enthusiastically. I still enjoyed the novel upon rereading it, but I do not think I would have liked it quite so much if I had not adored the book when I was younger. I still love the magic system, the villains of the novel, and the world-building of the novel, but I can now discern that the writing leaves a lot to be desired—characters are flat, their interactions awkward, and the author heavily “tells” instead of “shows”. Considering that a 15 year old actually wrote this book, it’s still a very impressive feat that deserves recognition, even if the book lacks some serious originality.

 

The novel begins when 15 year old Eragon stumbles across a magical blue stone while hunting in the eerie mountain range, known as the Spine. From the beginning, Eragon is marked as different, not only is he an expert archer, but he is one of the only people that ventures into the Spine, at all, let alone to return. Hoping the mysterious stone can feed his struggling farming family, consisting of his uncle and his cousin, he tries to pawn it off in the village. However, no one will buy it as the stone came from the taboo Spine.This turns out to be a stroke of luck when the stone hatches into a beautiful dragon named Saphira. Eragon becomes the last free dragon rider since the beginning of the reign of the evil emperor Galbatorix.

 

One of the strongest suits of the book is the origin story of Galbatorix, a former Rider driven mad by the death of his original dragon. Driven by grief, he steals a new dragon egg from the Riders, and together they destroy all but 13 of the Riders. These Riders, known as the Forsworn, betrayed and murdered the remainders of the Riders, killing all who refused to swear fealty to their king. Remind you of the Ringwraiths in Lord of the Rings? Me too. Anyways, Galbatorix ruthlessly hunts for Eragon, seeking to twist him to his side, and employing Urguls (definitely reminiscent of Orcs in Lord of the Rings, with their tougher brethren known as the Kull being ripped right from the Uruk-Hai’s pages), Ra'zac, and Shades to do his bidding. The Ra’Zac were my favorite of the supernatural creatures in Galbatorix’s employ, being creepy, mysterious, foul-smelling, and sinister.

 

But I did not enjoy the characterization of the good guys nearly as much as I did of that of the villains. The thing that most surprised me was how annoyed I was by the titular character. I did not remember Eragon being arrogant, impulsive, and quite frankly, an extremely poor decision maker. If Eragon hadn’t had Brom with him on the beginning of his quest, and Murtagh later, I’m 100% certain he would’ve gotten both himself and Saphira killed. He’s just that foolhardy. I think one of the great mysteries of this book was why Saphira chose Eragon out of all the possible candidates in the world; he certainly does not seem worthy of a dragon.

 

It was also irritating to me how quickly he picked things up. Eragon learns to become a master swordfighter in a mere few weeks, picks up magic easily (despite almost killing himself a few times in the process—something that one begins to expect with this boy), and is apparently an amazing archer as well. The only thing he does not really exceed at is using his brain—especially when it comes to women. Eragon meets the elf Arya in his dreams, and it is obvious that she is the one to whom Angela the witch was referring when she prophesied that Eragon would have an “epic romance,” (yes those are literally the words used to describe Eragon’s future love).

 

Of course, Arya is beautiful, capable, graceful, and powerful—both a master swordswoman and wielder of magic—she easily wipes the floor with Eragon on every field. But, Eragon is obnoxiously still concerned for her safety when she does not flee with the other women before the major battle of the novel. I cringed at every single one of their interactions, but that one was by far the worst. This is where publishing at a later age with more maturity and romantic experiences might have come in handy.

 

Though I really could not stand Eragon and found his dragon, Saphira pretty one-dimensional (she’s the epitome of the dragon stereotype, wise and bloodthirsty), I adored Murtagh. Murtagh is the son of Morzan, one of the Forsworn and is everything Eragon is not. He is capable, a strategist, and most importantly, calls Eragon out on his bullshit, something I wholeheartedly enjoyed.

 
“'What else could I do but help you with Ra’zac? And then later, at Gil’ead, how could I have left you with a clear conscience. The problem with you,’ said Murtagh, poking Eragon in the chest, ‘is that you’re so totally helpless you force everyone to take care of you!’”

 

 

I lived for that moment, so great was my growing dislike of Eragon. Murtagh also refuses to let his mind be invaded by anyone, is an amazing fighter, and pretty loyal to Eragon…so far. I often wished that I were reading Murtagh and Arya’s story, complete with their “epic romance” and not Eragon’s. I thought it would make for a much more interesting tale, rather than the typical goody-goody hero and his elf princess love interest.

 

Much of the magic of the book revolves around the ancient language of the elves. In this language, one cannot tell a blatant lie. I’ve read this in other books, such as Mercedes Lackey’s Obsidian Trilogy and cannot really say that Eragon does it better. Likewise, you cannot have heard of Eragon without hearing of the drama surrounding it—that it is a blatant rip-off of both Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. I’m not going to delve too deeply into these countless similarities as they are so obvious upon reading the novel and there are about a thousand other reviews remarking outlining them. Lucky for me, I love both those series and am still able to enjoy the book regardless of its glaring resemblances, most likely because I read it when I was around the same age of the author when he wrote it. And frankly, almost every genre is filled with tropes—this is especially obvious in dystopian YA novels and those are still popular—so I think the hatred this book is getting for imitating Lord of the Rings, the father of modern day fantasy, is a little egregious and over the top. Almost every fantasy novel bears some resemblance to Tolkien's work.

 

The magic system also makes it possible to gain complete control of a person or thing by knowing its true name. This makes it extremely dangerous to tell a person one’s true name, as this person can than use this true name to gain complete control over him or her. I have read in other reviews that this is similar to Tales from Earthsea but as I have not read those books, as of yet, I cannot comment. However, I always found this an interesting concept and feel that there will be much to learn surrounding Eragon’s true name, especially because the circumstances of his birth and his mother are so mysterious. I am looking forward to discovering that information out.

 

I personally had no issues with the world-building of this novel (other than the fact that it wasn’t the most original), and enjoyed reading about the different races, their habitats, and climates. I will say that it was certainly not the most complex world-building system I have ever read. Others remarked that it seemed childish that Eragon’s world was home to every climate—deserts, plains, winters, woodlands, etc.. This is a very good point, but I honestly did not notice or think anything of it during my read. I was more confused by how the dwarven city inside of a mountain was over 10 miles wide and could not really fathom it.

 

Though I liked the magic systems and world-building, I really struggled with the author’s voice. He has a tendency to state things outright rather than to show them to the reader. For instance, as stated earlier, during Angela’s fortunetelling for Eragon, she blatantly predicts that he will have an “epic romance.” It does not poetically proclaim or insinuate why it is epic, but instead, simplistically states it. Similarly, I was annoyed by how many times Eragon stated during his training with Brom that he was now lean. The boy was a farmer and gamesman and you are telling me he was not already muscular? Sigh. I guess this was an attempt to appeal to the physical ideal of a warrior, but it would have been better if his clothes no longer fit due to increased muscle mass, rather than Eragon simply telling the reader.

 

At other times, the author is unable to ramp up an exciting atmosphere where the reader wonders if the hero will make it. During the largest battle of the book, Eragon is sliding down an extremely dangerous, erm, dwarf slide, and I felt absolutely no tension or fear for his safety. This dwarf slide is something that has killed humans in the past, but it feels very anti-climactic. Instead of a harrowing rush back to the battlefield, it felt as if the author was describing the weather or something:

 
“The stone slide was smooth as lacquered wood. With the leather underneath him, he accelerated almost instantly to a frightening speed, the walls blurring and the curve of the slide pressing him against the wall. Eragon lay completely flat so he would go faster. The air rushed past his helm, making it vibrate like a weather ane in a gale. The trough was too confined for him and he was perilously close to flying out, but as long as he kept his arms and legs still, he was safe. It was a swift descent, but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom.”

 

I am planning to read the rest of the novels in the Inheritance Cycle, as I never got past the second book, and am curious to see where it all goes. I hope to find that as the author aged, there will be greater creativity in his books, and more maturity in his character development. But ultimately, I am reading these books for nostalgic fun and not a complex, epic fantasy story. If you are someone who gets annoyed by tropes, whiny male leads, “rip-offs,” or most enjoys super serious fantasy reads, you will not enjoy this book. Ultimately, I think the best possible audience for the series is someone who, like myself when I first read Eragon, was dipping their toes in the fantasy pond for the very first time.

It is a fantasy novel that for its effect on my own reading experiences, has become to stand in a higher point of personal reverie in the world of fantasy literature than even that of the LOTR trilogy.

That's a pretty massive statement to say, especially considering the amount of praise and honour that the LOTR trilogy has been given, especially in the context of having now been studying fantasy in fiction. However, I have found that when reading the LOTR series and comparing them to the Inheritance Cycle series, I think that the LOTR are dry and do not have nearly the same exhilarating acceleration in its writing as Paolini had in his first book after having it been published at only 18. That being said, some allowances must be granted because the prose and style of Paolini's writing is certainly not near the same proficiency as that of Tolkein's LOTR trilogy and that of Paolini's first book, Eragon. Nevertheless, I will say that it is all the more fantastic to see the growth in Paolini's later books as his style of writing becomes so much more developed and mature. Tolkein has an incredible mind for understanding the motifs of fantasy and for being able to turn them into such an exquisite tail of adventure with beautiful scenes of imagery depicted throughout. However, for the sheer emotion and driving force behind a fantastical story filled with wild and emaginative characters, and a plot line that ignites such a thrill as the Inheritance cycle does, I find that Paolini's Eragon supersedes that of the LOTR trilogy as a fantasy novel to be enjoyed and read over and over again.

I cannot deny the gravity of the influence that the LOTR trilogy has had on the fantasy genre, however I have been having a hard time even getting through the series for the first time, let alone the fact that this is now the fourth time I've finished the Eragon novel. So, least to say. Eragon is by far one of my most favourite novels and I am certain that I will be reading this series over and over again in the future. There is something that I cannot explain about the story line, (and I will admit that nostalgia most likely has a part to play), but every time that I have read this book again, I feel the same uncontainable excitement that I had the first time I read this novel. And every few years I get pulled back in to experience the story all over again. And every time I read this story again, I see more and more of the subtle foreshadowing that Paolini used to elude to the future story that unfolds in the later three novels. It just leaves me with such a resounding sense of how much care and thought was put into this beautiful storyline and its characters, and it shows in just how well executed the fourth and final instalment of this series was. Just. Everything. So fantastic.",book always one absolute favourite novels written far fantasy novel effect reading experiences become stand higher point personal reverie world fantasy literature even lotr trilogy pretty massive statement say especially considering amount praise honour lotr trilogy given especially context studying fantasy fiction however found reading lotr series comparing inheritance cycle series think lotr dry nearly exhilarating acceleration writing paolini first book published said allowances must granted prose style paolini writing certainly near proficiency tolkein lotr trilogy paolini first book eragon nevertheless say fantastic see growth paolini later books style writing becomes much developed mature tolkein incredible mind understanding motifs fantasy able turn exquisite tail adventure beautiful scenes imagery depicted throughout however sheer emotion driving force behind fantastical story filled wild emaginative characters plot line ignites thrill inheritance cycle find paolini eragon supersedes lotr trilogy fantasy novel enjoyed read deny gravity influence lotr trilogy fantasy genre however hard time even getting series first time let alone fact fourth time finished eragon novel least say eragon far one favourite novels certain reading series future something explain story line admit nostalgia likely part play every time read book feel uncontainable excitement first time read novel every years get pulled back experience story every time read story see subtle foreshadowing paolini used elude future story unfolds later three novels leaves resounding sense much care thought put beautiful storyline characters shows well executed fourth final instalment series everything fantastic,True,Positive,Positive

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.75,"Christopher Paolini wrote Eragon as the first book in the Inheritance Trilogy at the young age of fifteen. The trilogy became a cycle not even two months ago when the fourth and final book of the cycle released. Eragon is a young farmer whose life takes a complete turnaround when he finds a dragon egg, his only remaining family is murdered or estranged, and becomes the last known Rider. This book is an incredible ride though the mind of Paolini and anyone who reads it feels as if they are on Saphira back going though the numerous adventures themselves.
One of the biggest things I loved about this book was the style in which it was written. In most books I read, the only thing I can think of is how I would change it, but I couldn’t think of one single tweak from the original. Paolini writes in a way that is easily understandable, but still requires a dictionary for myself personally and that is how it should be seeing as I’m only in high school. I like the use of languages in the book, and how a knurlan can begin in English and suddenly slip into dwarvish without missing a single beat. This kind of automatic transition makes the reader feel like Paolini is just a fly on the wall watching the events in reality and simply transcribing them for all of us. Eragon has glimpses into the lives, legends, histories, myths, and beliefs of the many races in this book. These little intricacies turn the countries into living breathing nations just like pictures and furniture turn a house into a home. One of my only problems with this book is that most every twist is hopelessly predictable, and then every once in a while there is one surprise that could give the reader whiplash if they read too quickly!
Eragon is definitely one of the best fantasy books around, and every lover of the genre should read it, if only to compare the descriptions of magical staples (elves, magicians, dragons, etc.) to other books. This book is an amazing read and I can’t wait to read the rest of the books.

I've started this re read because its always nice to see how your reading tastes change over the years and whether your old loves still hold as much weight.

I'm happy to say that while its not as great as i remembered, Eragon still holds a special place in my heart as the book that opened up epic fantasy to younger minds. Before Eragon, it felt the only books of this scope were for older readers and so i'll always love and respect it for bringing the gap between old and new fantasy and make it palatable for younger readers.

I realised i'm not a fan of the play by play style of writing that was pretty prevalent back in the day. I doubt this story would be picked up as quickly nowadays as it takes a while to get to the real point of anything. It is wonderfully packed full of old magic and elves and dwarves and all the ingredients for an epic fantasy but for me it is very slow before the fun of the final battle.

I will always love CP for including brown people very early on, before it became a tick box for some writers they feel they need to complete to be considered diverse.

I stopped reading the series after book 2 for unknown reasons so i'm really excited to continue and see how the full story actually ends. As well as learn more about Galbatorix and that shady ass biyatch Murtagh....",started read always nice see reading tastes change years whether old loves still hold much weight happy say great remembered eragon still holds special place heart book opened epic fantasy younger minds eragon felt books scope older readers always love respect bringing gap old new fantasy make palatable younger readers realised fan play play style writing pretty prevalent back day doubt story would picked quickly nowadays takes get real point anything wonderfully packed full old magic elves dwarves ingredients epic fantasy slow fun final battle always love cp including brown people early became tick box writers feel need complete considered diverse stopped reading series book unknown reasons really excited continue see full story actually ends well learn galbatorix shady ass biyatch murtagh,True,Positive,Positive

I think I have reread the series since the final book came out, so I thought I would do that. Rereading this I found it interesting that one of the characters gives Eragon a prophecy, and I remembered most of the things in the prophecy. Paolini had planned right at the beginning what was going to happen. Which I thought was pretty cool, as some of the last book felt a bit rushed or unplanned (from what I remember).

This is the story of a teenager, Eragon, who finds a mysterious blue stone in the mountains, this stone then turns out to be a dragon egg. Eragon touches the baby dragon and becomes part of the legendary Dragon Riders. Chaos follows. Eragon and Saphira (his dragon) leave their home village to hunt down two creatures called Ra'zac, who came looking for the stone, and murdered Eragon's uncle who raised him. Eragon is accompanied by the towns storyteller Brom, who knows of Eragon's dragon and begins teaching Eragon small things about being a Rider, refusing to tell Eragon how he knows these things.

Along the road, Brom tells Eragon of the true nature of the last living Rider, King Galbatorix, who killed out the other Riders when his dragon died and the Riders refused to give him another one. There is a group called the Varden who fight against him, but they need a Rider on their side to have any hope of defeating the King who has ruled for the last 100 years.

Eragon is faced with a number of challenges throughout this book, which side should be choose? The side of the King or the side of the Varden?

I remember when I would enter his room as a kid, the trilogy was there on his red bookshelf, tattered and sitting beside a glossary of dragons. Fantasy has always been beloved in our household, especially between my brother and I’s imaginations. He used to sketch different wings and write symbols for a new alphabet while I would hold one of my many stuffed unicorns and try to decipher a message.

Recently, the name “Eragon” resurfaced after many years of dormancy when at a family meal my brother compared it favorably to “Lord of the Rings” and caused quite the controversy. Another trilogy for which there are certainly parallels, LotR is my father’s most legendary reading experience. He, being someone who doesn’t voraciously read, often remarks about finishing the classic trilogy in a few days when asked about his favorite books.

I guess all that is to say, I have no comment, no criticism, no desire or need to line a teen boy’s imagination up beside a potential inspiration. All I had while listening to this audiobook was joy—joy at the lovable characters, the wonderful voices of the narration, the journey as it wound and twisted simply, the sincerity and world, and the old childhood wish I always had to ride a dragon.

Joy, most of all, at feeling so connected to my dearest Morgan who happily joined in conversation with me about each new moment I experienced, ready to muse in the way the Hughes family loves to about stories that are special to us.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,5.0,"Eragon by Christopher Paolini was one of my favourite books growing up, and despite the obvious influences and clichés, it is still one of my favourite fantasy books.

Eragon might be filled with clichés and tropes of the fantasy genre – harking back to J. R. R. Tolkien especially – but it can’t be denied that the book itself is fantastic. The world is well realised.

Elements of worldbuilding such as languages, cultures, history, and lore are so well done. So, despite wearing his influences on his sleeve, Christopher Paolini did an incredible job of creating a world and a story that is wonderful and exciting to experience.

Eragon is our classic fantasy farm boy-turned-hero. He’s deeply motivated by a strong moral code and compassion for those who need help. His relationship with his dragon, Saphira, is heart-warming. They become so close, like family, and their dialogue together is some of the best in the book.

We don’t see much of the other characters in Eragon, but I’d like to briefly mention them anyway. Brom is a fantastic “wise wizard” character. He’s kind and compassionate but won’t suffer fools (I figure that’s the way he’d say it!).

We don’t see a huge amount of Arya which is a shame, but she’s snarky and brave which is a good introduction to her character. Murtagh’s plot is a little unsurprising, but it’s done well, and his character has surprising depth.

Talking of surprising depth, the “boss round” villain of Eragon is a shade called Durza who we meet at the very beginning of the book – there is little depth to his motivations, however he is creepy as Hell and a great main threat for us to see Eragon against.

Overall, Eragon is a typical travelogue fantasy story but it’s world, Alagaësia, is a wonderfully detailed and realised. It feels as though we have only been introduced to the main characters so far, but future books may show more of their development and growth.

If you want an easy read where the world and the people are fascinating and exciting to explore, Eragon is the perfect book to dive right in to.

I saw the movie Eragon several years ago and thought it was a really cool story–especially the dragon of course. I heard from many people that the book was way better and had a lot more details, which didn’t surprise me since that’s generally the way things go. So, I added it to my TBR and finally got around to picking it up this year.

As promised, there were definitely a ton more details in the book. In fact the first twenty minutes of the movie was about the first half of the book by my estimation. A lot of things happened that weren’t touched on in the film and there was a lot of useful backstory, but sometimes things can go overkill. I thought maybe...

At least for me, this book was a cornerstone in how I began to appreciate fantasy worlds, creatures, magic systems, and languages. It is definitely a much lighter read than other fantasy worlds, but I maintain that this is not a fault - this is a bridge, a sample of the treasures that the fantasy genre has to offer.

In a way, though, part of the benefit of reading this book is that it is the first step in a graduation of quality as the reader grows and refines their taste. In other ways, the immature writing lowers the bar for fantasy a bit - every time I revisit this book I recoil from the blunt dialogue and narration a little bit more, and find myself grasping for the next books in the series despite them only being marginally better.",spite everything spite ripped lord rings star wars original trilogy enjoyable book easily kickstart young reader love fantasy least book cornerstone began appreciate fantasy worlds creatures magic systems languages definitely much lighter read fantasy worlds maintain fault bridge sample treasures fantasy genre offer way though part benefit reading book first step graduation quality reader grows refines taste ways immature writing lowers bar fantasy bit every time revisit book recoil blunt dialogue narration little bit find grasping next books series despite marginally better,True,Positive,Positive

Yeah, this doesn’t hold up as well against some of the stories that it drew inspiration from, but as a little kid I loved it and as an adult I still enjoyed it with some doses of nostalgia.

Both being huge readers, we talked about books that we were both into and shared our favorite titles. I was a Twihard through and through at that time but my husband was and still is obsessed with Eragon. From that very first conversation about books, he made it a mission of his to get me to read it.

Fantasy, other than Harry Potter, isn't really my thing so I struggle through books like this. I finally pushed that aside, however, and decided to give in and placate him. I watched the movie when it first came out and, according to my husband, this was my first mistake. He hates the movie with a fiery passion. But since I did enjoy the movie, I thought why not? Maybe I'll enjoy the book.

I was wrong. Just like usual, I struggled so hard through this book. I first gave it a try with my husband's tattered old paperback copy. I couldn't finish it. It just didn't hold my attention long enough for me to get into the story. I barely made it past the first chapter. Not long after, I fell down the rabbit hole of audiobooks and found myself speeding through books quicker than I've ever been able to (slow reader, here). So I thought, hey, maybe if I'm listening to someone read it, maybe I can do it.

And I did, but just like before, I struggled through it. I was doing great for the first half of the book. I was into the story and enjoying it. Then the constant over-description of every little thing got to me. The decently slow pace and wordiness of the book just completely lost my attention and I couldn't stay focused on it. I found myself wanting to listen to something else.

So, unfortunately for my husband, I didn't enjoy Eragon.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,3.0,"I just had to read through the other reviews of this book before attempting to write my own, vaguely suspecting what I'd find there...

...and I was not disappointed. Man, do people get angry about stuff.

If a review is my explanation of what I did with the experience of reading a book, in this case, Eragon, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the heck out of it. Familiar as Brooks, Eddings, Salvatore, and any number of other, far-less attacked, fantasy stories, the 500 pages of good, clean fun (remember that?). There are wild settings, dragons, monsters, intrigue, dragons, legendary swords, deep lore, dragons, and a pretty sweet final battle.

Did I mention there were dragons? Dragons are awesome. And there was an awesome dragon in Eragon. She was a character that reasoned, acted, and experienced inner conflict. I'm not sure I've seen that before, even in something like The Dragonriders of Pern. Certainly not on this scale. I might even say that Saphira was one of the most memorable dragon-characters I've ever come across, at least recently. Certainly more memorable than the dragons that showed up in Star Wars.

If nothing else, the book tells a decent story. It's as similar to Star Wars as Star Wars is to, say Dune or Foundation. It's as similar to Lord of the Rings as that ""First of Epics"" is to the dozens of Norse myths that Tolkien adapted for it. Like those others, you can tell that Paolini knows where he's going in his version of the tale, dropping hints about parentage, past relationships, hidden agendas, and order yet to be established.

Additionally, he does a good job with the character development and writes a believable 15-year-old's voice, especially as that 15-year-old is having a really, really crappy year. Paolini builds an interesting world with its own complex history, and while its similarities to other fantasies are certainly apparent, it's certainly not plagiarism any more than Pawn of Prophecy is. It's a genre novel, and a pretty good one, considering that the bulk of the work was done by a person who had yet to graduate from high school.

I did find one fairly glaring struggle that Paolini had in telling his story. (No, it's not 'coming up with an original plot,' mostly because there's no such thing. This plot is as original as any.) That struggle is a struggle of style: he writes the actions of the characters, especially the hero, in exactly the same way. During a particularly important chase sequence, Eragon has to push his abilities and endurance to a previously-untested level of intensity. This is a big moment for the Hero is his journey, as he has emerged from the Abyss of, and experienced Death & Rebirth in, the Gil'ead prison. During this chase, he's now finding how strong his ability to affect change actually is, and is going to be as the stakes get inevitably higher. Paolini seems to understand that this is a crucial moment, but the actions get no special treatment in the language, nor does Paolini provide a special reflection on the significance of what Eragon is now able to do. It's as significant a moment as the great finale is, but like that finale, its presentation is very matter of fact in terms of voice, and that lets the air out of the climactic events of the novel, to some degree.

Still, the story plays, and as far as debut novels go, this one is more that up to the task of shouldering the crazy expectations that fans of this type of literature tends to have. Paolini writes like a guy who loves this type of story, and those types of writers tend to produce the best mythology: Tolkien did it first (and yes, he's still the best), and a century later, Sanderson does it three times a year (and no, I'm not comparing Paolini to Sanderson). I enjoy books like Eragon because it connects me to the great pool of myth and storytelling out there, and Paolini's contributions are not shy about accessing that pool as a writer any more than I am as a reader. Eragon was a very good book, and I look forward to the next installment in the Inheritance Cycle with enthusiasm.",read reviews book attempting write vaguely suspecting find disappointed man people get angry stuff review explanation experience reading book case eragon like say enjoyed heck familiar brooks eddings salvatore number attacked fantasy stories pages good clean fun remember wild settings dragons monsters intrigue dragons legendary swords deep lore dragons pretty sweet final battle mention dragons dragons awesome awesome dragon eragon character reasoned acted experienced inner conflict sure seen even something like dragonriders pern certainly scale might even say saphira one memorable ever come across least recently certainly memorable dragons showed star wars nothing else book tells decent story similar star wars star wars say dune foundation similar lord rings first epics dozens norse myths tolkien adapted like others tell paolini knows going version tale dropping hints parentage past relationships hidden agendas order yet established additionally good job character development writes believable voice especially really really crappy year paolini builds interesting world complex history similarities fantasies certainly apparent certainly plagiarism pawn prophecy genre novel pretty good one considering bulk work done person yet graduate high school find one fairly glaring struggle paolini telling story original plot mostly thing plot original struggle struggle style writes actions characters especially hero exactly way particularly important chase sequence eragon push abilities endurance level intensity big moment hero journey emerged abyss experienced death rebirth prison chase finding strong ability affect change actually going stakes get inevitably higher paolini seems understand crucial moment actions get special treatment language paolini provide special reflection significance eragon able significant moment great finale like finale presentation matter fact terms voice lets air climactic events novel degree still story plays far debut novels go one task shouldering crazy expectations fans type literature tends paolini writes like guy loves type story types writers tend produce best mythology tolkien first yes still best century later sanderson three times year comparing paolini sanderson enjoy books like eragon connects great pool myth storytelling paolini contributions shy accessing pool writer reader eragon good book look forward next installment inheritance cycle enthusiasm,True,Positive,Positive

Okay so in this story the main character (Eragon) is not the brightest candle on the cake but he is also precious and needs to be protected at all costs. Thank god the author has given us a female dragon, Saphira, to do that job.
But is not the only thing Christopher Paolini has given us. Throughout the story he has also provided us with a Gandalf like fatherfigure who doesn't take any shit, a weird and mysterious friend who is also the son of the second most evil dragon rider there ever was (perfect betrayal material), no unnecessarily played out love story that would distract the reader from the plot, dwarves, elfs (?), a witch (and a cat - werecat (?) actually), a rebel alliance, a black leader of said rebel alliance and his black daughter, a kick-ass battle at the end of the book where said sweet cinnamon roll main character kills off the evilest evil we have met at that point into the story and a mysterious but sentimental and slightly curious ending.
The world building is beautifully done, the characters (humans and -the one- dragon alike) are relatable and three dimensional. There is also room left for further character development at the end of this book since there are three more books in the series.

This book was the inverse of Dune for me. Dune was a book where I loved the story, the lore, the setting, the vibe, and I enjoyed it in theory and discussion. But for some reason my engagement of the story did not match my enjoyment of everything else. I would rate the entertainment value of Dune as a 2/5 for me.

Whereas I would rate my entertainment make of Eragon as around a 3/5. I didn’t tear through it, it wasn’t a huge page-turner for me, but I was generally engaged. However, in this case it was the story, lore and other background pieces that fell drastically short.

The similarities to Lord of the Rings are well documented and not worth going into extensive detail here. But they were glaring. This story read like a teenager deliberately trying to write his version of LotR (which may quite literally have been the case). I think the people who say it is plagiarism are blowing it out of proportion, but the issue is notable.

Not to mention the fact that it follows the “Hero’s Journey” plot-line used by so many Sci-Fi/Fantsy books extremely rigidly. It just felt like I had read every story beat somewhere before.

Those are the overarching things that make this book feel so derivative but there are other smaller tropes scattered all over the story (saving the captured princess, finding a companion who is secretly royalty, deus ex machina, etc). Including the fact that the only significant female character (other than Saphira) mentions being raped by captors. That isn’t a problem unique to Eragon, but it is a sad trope that plagues the fantasy genre and one that this story should have left behind.

The characters were not bad but there wasn’t much engaging about them. Eragon has quite a bit of tragedy strike him and yet he absolutely refuses to not be a totally static bump-on-a-log of a character. I can’t think of a person in this story with even a hint of dynamic change from beginning to end. It just overall added to my “bleh” feelings toward the book.

That being said, the prose was impressive especially when you consider it was written by a teenager and the pacing was solid and kept me engaged. 2.5 stars feels so harsh because I don’t have anything I DRASTICALLY disliked here. Just a lot that I KINDA disliked and very little positive to make up for it. I largely just feel bad because I read this off of passionate recommendation and I don’t like letting people down.

I did NOT hate this book. I get the appeal and think there could be a scenario where I even recommend it. But giving it the same rating I gave Dune or The Count of Monte Cristo feels like a crime.

Admittedly, I am no longer part of the target audience for this book.

I've wanted to read this book for a long time. Ever since my cousin told me about it when we were about 13, I suppose. I always liked fantasy, especially dragons, and he really loved it, so I thought I would check it out. I'd tried to read it several times and had never gotten through the prologue. Not because I thought it was bad but because something else always came up, and I forgot about it.

Finally, I decided I'd try this on audiobook, and I'm glad I did. The narrator, Gerard Doyle, was very good. He didn't go overboard on the voices, but he made them all fun and interesting enough. I especially liked the accent he used for Murtagh (though I was very confused as to why everyone had an English accent, yet Murtagh was what... Irish? Scottish?).

I was surprised to find this was a bestselling children's book. Honestly, I know I would not have finished it if I'd just been reading it. For about 75% of the book, Eragon is just on a journey across Middle Earth (or wherever it is he's supposed to live) doing the same thing over and over and over again. And they talk... a lot. It's like a giant information dump, and it's like Paolini wanted to shove down your throat every last detail he'd considered for this world. Which is fine, explaining all these details, but I felt it could have been weaved in a little better.

So why the four star rating? Because I really did enjoy the story. A seemingly ordinary farm boy discovers he's basically the last remaining dragon rider in the world? Pretty cool. (Yeah, I know it sounds like Star Wars, but I can give you tons of beloved books that have the same plot as other beloved books. Ready Player One? Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Not to mention Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, and Avatar all have the exact same plot.)

Yes, I definitely thought it was a bit slow, but the audiobook didn't make it seem that way. And I was intrigued enough by the ending that I will read Eldest as well.

Oh man, this was such a nostalgia trip! I first read this book in the 6th grade, and proceeded to read a book in this series every year following, except for 8th grade where I read both Brisingr and Inheritance. I had memorized where in the book my favorite parts were so I could flip to them. I slept with a copy on my bed next to me. To say that I loved this series is putting it mildly hah

I think the thing that enamored me most wasn’t the world or the plot or the characters, which are all admittedly juvenile and cliche, but rather the simple fact that Paolini himself wrote it when he was just a teenager. As someone who wanted to write and didn’t think she had the skills or the ability to craft a romping fantasy, that really inspired me. Besides the simple pleasure of a wish-fulfillment dragon fantasy, this book gave me that at least.

I also find it interesting that my love of this world didn’t diminish because of this reread, though perhaps the rest of the series is still up in the air on that (I remember not liking the last book but solely for the most petty reasons hah). I say this because my other series obsession of that era in my life was Percy Jackson, and for the most part, my enthusiasm decreased significantly about that series when I reread it as an adult.

I think the book that makes you a reader will be with you forever. Eragon is that for me, and there are not many stories where every single detail is still so vividly imprinted in my mind, nor so many characters that are so utterly comforting, nor a world that is so dear. I love this series more than any other book I've ever read, because of the huge impact it had on me, for the fact that it taught me to love storytelling, that stories can be fun and challenging and heartbreaking and soothing all at once, and that's the true joy of reading.

Murtagh has also been my favourite character of all time for almost two decades at this point, and there's something in Paolini's skills that in a story so strongly about heroes, my most beloved character is the doomed anti-hero. I'm so excited for the second book now, and while yes, I am reading this a bit slower than I would have liked, it is with such childish, full enthusiasm that I haven't been this happy in a long time.

Really enjoyed reading a quality fantasy book again but the lack of any well-written and prominent women in the entirety of the book was discouraging. Ayra is the lead woman (besides the dragon, Saphira, who doesn't quite count for me) if there is one, and she spends most the book unconscious. The most interaction the reader has with her for the vast majority of the book is Eragon's description of her perfectly ""sculpted"" features. She's an elf, so she almost gets a pass, but all of the women in the book except Angela (by far my favorite) are there to be gawked at as romantic interests, which I was rather unimpressed with. Hopefully they get some more character development in the next book.

The plot moved quickly enough to keep me engaged (although having to finish the book in 2 weeks before it was automatically returned to my library didn't hurt) and the political background was developed enough to be engaging. I felt it could have been shorter and some of the side excursions weren't really necessary, but nothing was so bad that I completely lost interest. Eragon is a bit stereotypical for a lead protagonist (farm boy to chosen one, with special powers like no Rider before him!), but this book was written in 2002 when maybe he wasn't quite so stereotypical. Many of the sticky situations Eragon finds himself in are resolved by the just-in-time appearance of a friend or ally, which got a bit tiresome. I would have liked to see him find his own way out or pay the consequence more often.

Paolini definitely put a lot of time into developing his world.

This was a re-read after 10+ years and I was positively surprised how well this book holds up to my memory. Was this a book written by a 15 y/o for other teenagers, yeah, and you can tell. The Star Wars/LotR inspiration is even more apparent to 25 y/o me than it ever was to teenage-me. Still for what it is, this is an entertaining story. This has some overall pacing issues but I love how much time Eragon actually spends with Brom. Knowing where this story will go and the impact Brom will have on Eragon going forward, them having months to build a relationship is something I can excuse the slight dragging of the story during the first half of the book for. 

Speaking of Eragon. Is he a dramatic child? Yes. But he is <i>my</i> dramatic child, whom I love very much. Within this story he already grows so much as a person and also shows this deep moral code of conduct. As the protagonist of a fantasy book and in possession of a dragon, he might be initially driven by revenge but shows again and again that you don’t have to be needlessly cruel or overly violent to be compelling or threatening. 

What I’ve forgotten was how adorable baby Saphira was and how many cute interactions she and Eragon have throughout the book.

I read this book originally in 8th grade. When my teacher didn't have the second book I abandoned the series. Later, in my first semester of college, I rediscovered the Inheritance Cycle. So it's a little ironic how I am reading it once again in my last semester. This series is basically Star Wars meets J.R.R Tolkien, but it really is amazing. It is filled with adventure and travel, and we so far have met some very important characters.

Eragon I find is a very interesting character, but he is also very immature. He's a 15 year old boy who thinks he is absolutely right about everything. He gets told off a few times by both Brom and Arya, which I found really good for his development as a character. I also liked all the little hints and foreshadowing, when you're re-reading a book that is one of my favorite parts. Some of the details were very important there and it was so fun to know what it meant and Eragon didn't.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.5,"So I finally read Eragon (borrowed from a friend) and I have Some Thoughts.

Back when the book came out, I had a certain bias against it. Almost all fantasy writers at one time or another have a novel inspired by Tolkien with their own version of orcs, dwarves, elves and the like. Usually it's when they're very young, and usually it doesn't ever get published.

Not so with Christopher Paolini, whose parents had their own publishing company, homeschooled him and edited his book, then published it and traveled with him around the country to promote it. At age 17.

Was I jealous? Oh, hell yes.

So I didn't read it until now. And here is what I think :

1. It's a much better first book than Twilight. Sure, that's maybe a low bar, but it's true. It *does* read like a very young person wrote it, but you can see him grow as a writer even in just the first book by the end.

2. There's a decent world building backbone here. I was impressed by how imaginative some of it was... Sure, he had help, but that doesn't exist in a vacuum. Good world building is HARD.

3. That being said, based on JUST this book, I'm not sure I entirely get why it became so wildly sucessful. Maybe because a lot of young people can't read adult epic fantasy yet, and this is a gateway to that? It clearly tapped into something.

I'll read the rest of the series... I hear it gets quite a bit better as it goes along, not unlike Harry Potter. At any rate, I wasn't groaning through it and there were elements I enjoyed, so it gets 2(.5) stars.

Edit: Changed my review to make it more consistent with the rest of my reviews.

Overall, I enjoyed it more than expected however my expectations were low. Knew about this book since middle school where a friend proudly displayed it on desk every drama class and reread it 8x a year. I read several chapters and, as a brash young writer, thought 'but I can do better!'

Then I returned to Milton.

Now as an adult, I can appreciate Paolini's ability to craft a story so many people love. Is it a mix of LOTR and Star Wars? Sure, but I can forgive tropes and repackaged story elements provided there are twists and turns. Do the turns of Eragon pay off?

Not so much.

Pros:

-Good novel-length story for a young writer. Is this enough to say it would beat out other novels written by 15-18 year olds if they had the same resources as his family? Tough to answer.

-The beginning felt like starting a 90s role-playing game. I was interested in slowly exploring the world, and I appreciated the several chapters devoted to life in Carvahall.

-Saphira and Eragon have a developing bond as rider and dragon. She's less plot-device or prop as she's able to speak with Eragon.

-Brom was more entertaining than I expected.
Spoiler
I enjoyed the half with him more than the second half following his death.

-Um, Murtagh's okay?

Cons:

-A lot of tropes/cliches. Eragon himself is standard-hero material: two-dimensional development, skills come easily, able to get a crowd 'ooo'ing when he makes smart remarks at soldiers, etc. The villain is a typical big bad. I didn't care for the creature enemies.

-The second half of the book didn't catch my interest.

-Writing is okay for author's age at time of story. I wouldn't consider it lyrical or poetic, and sometimes the level of detail is unnecessary.

-The characters were overall okay, but none I loved.

-Since it's a trope-heavy book, the twists may not feel rewarding to readers who encountered similar.

Speared baby scene because that means the villains are REALLY bad, okay.

This is actually a re-read, since I've read it when I was about 12,13 years old,but since I made it a mission to finally finish this series this year, I had to pick book 1 one up again because I could barely remember what happened during the first two books. I really like fantasy and am amazed at how much effort the author put into creating this new world, it's mythology and new language. Yes, it drinks from other famous fantasy novels , especially Tolkien (yes, Arya DOES sound exactly like Arwen from LOTR and the Ur'gals reminded me a lot the Orcs. No coincidence about it). That is no detriment to the book, which is interesting and managed to keep me reading even though about 1/3 through I remembered what happened, including stuff from book 2 that are very obvious even during this first installment. Again, I didn't found that to be a problem to be personally. The writing flows really well, even though I found it slow paced at times, especially the beginning. There were too many unimportant things thrown in the middle just to make the book bigger, and that slowed things a bit, and that's one of the things that dropped the rating for me. Also, you can see how inexperienced the writer was at the time - he was only 15 years old,after all - some paragraphs and lines of the main characters felt a little bit childish and odd to me, but I think that as the series progresses, this will stop being an issue. After finishing, I know why I liked these book so much when I was younger and why I wanted to finish the series.

This book had a lot of potential, but was a let down. It was recommended to me by a friend, who calls this ""The best series ever"", so I thought it would be amazing!

I was wrong.

I mean, I liked it, but not as much as I thought I would.

Let's just start with what I liked about it:

I think that Paolini writes action very well. During all of the action scenes (of which there are not enough), I was on the edge of my seat! Things just kept happening,and you couldn't predict them! Shades and dragons appeared and there were sword-fights and magic-fights, and more!
One of my favorite aspects of these books was the relationship between Eragon and Saphira. I loved how much they cared for each other, and how they had each other's backs, while still having little fights. I thought it was really cute. Also, the fact that Eragon and Saphira could read each other's minds, and could meld their strength together to perform tiring magic spells was a really cool concept.
All the magical creatures like Werecats and Urgals were really great additions to the story, and made it more intriguing. You just wanted to know what they were!
Paolini wrote the first draft of this story at fifteen. That said, he needs to be given some props. The writing, when not info-dumpy, was very descriptive, and the word choice was excellent!
Also, some of the plot points caught you by surprise, which I always like to have, even though they were sad. :(

My main problem with this book was that it was about 300 pages too long. In an attempt to do some world-building, Paolini just dumps pages and pages of information on you, and it is boring as hell. I had to drag myself through those portions. I remember telling myself to just read another 10, 20 pages. I was forcing myself. That's why I recommend this book to people who are willing to fight their way through pages of unnecessary crap to get to the good stuff. The book only gets very interesting near the end. That was the point where I couldn't put it down. Other than the end, the book moved at a snail's pace, minus the rare action scenes that dot the middle.
Oh, another thing I forgot to address. What was with Eragon and the elf woman? It really got on my nerves that he didn't even know who she was, but he still found the need to feel a sense of responsibility towards her, and rescue her. I think it's safe to say that he didn't know her, yet he was in love with her.

Really Christopher Paolini? REALLY?


David Tennant is not amused.

I first read this book the summer before I went into fifth grade. Was it really that long ago? Wow. Of course, I fell in love. And since then, I've read this book a few times since. I don't have an exact count, but I'd put it around...erm, a...high number. We'll just leave it there. (This is a reread, in case you haven't noticed. That's why I'm not doing my normal review style.)

I have to admit, though, it had been awhile since I had read it last. I wanted to have an Eragon Marathon and read all the books before the final one came out, but I was a bit nervous. I hadn't read the series since I started looking deeper into books and doing my reviews and all that. I was a bit afraid it wouldn't be as good as I remembered.

Haha. I was worried about that? Wow. It was every bit as good as I remembered, if not better.

Sometimes you miss things the first time you read a book. As in, why did I not remember a single thing about a giant slide? And when you've read the entire series many times, you see things you couldn't have possibly seen the first time through. Mainly foreshadowing. There is some fantastic foreshadowing here, people. Mostly surrounding the Bromsson thing.

I love this book. I don't care how much it has in common with Star Wars. Let me ask you this: Does Star Wars have an equivalent to Angela, Roran, or Orik? Does Han Solo have a dragon? No, I didn't think so.

The setting never fails to draw me in. It's so intricate, yet so broad and expansive. I enjoy referring back to the map as the characters travel. I love the concepts, too, with the dragons and Riders and Ancient Language and...everything.

The characters, though, are what really drives this book home for me. They're fantastic. I even managed to like Eragon this time. When I was younger, I wasn't a huge fan of the main character himself. Now that I look back, I think this had to do with the fact that he was fifteen and I was much younger. Since we're the same age now, I find him much easier to connect to, and to appreciate as a character. And because we're on the subject of characters....

MURTAGH!!!!!!!!

Probably my favorite character of all time, right there. (Yeah, for those of you that know what happens in Eldest--you can probably guess how I feel about that.) That's a pretty high honor, seeing as I read a lot of books per year. Multiply that by the number of characters in each book...that's a lot.

I should probably save some of my Inheritance is amazing and epic and all that rant for later.

I wasn't expecting not to like it tbh, because I've heard only good things about it, so I was ready for an epic tale full of adventure and dragons. Boy, was I wrong.

First of all, the writing style makes this book hard to read. The exposition is unreal, more than 75% of this book is exposition and I felt I was reading a story within a story. I understand that the readers need context but I believe it could be done differently, because I almost died of boredom. The action scenes were few, compared to the portion of characters talking, traveling and then more talking!

Our main boy, Eragon, is stupid. And I can back up that statement. Let's start with the fact that he decide to find his uncle's murderers and kill them, without having battle training or sense of direction. Monsters were pursuing them and he decided to try and kill them all with magic, when he'd only been training a few days and almost killed himself. He went into a temple knowing he might meet the bad guys (even though they were supposed to be incognito) and he was utterly surprised when they found him and almost killed him. He was in a prison cell and was complaining that the food wasn't good enough and that the soldiers were making noise and wouldn't let him rest. He broke his hand falling from a rock. Need I say more?

I believe that even the author knew that Eragon would be useless alone, that's why we don't see Eragon doing anything by himself in this whole 600+ page novel. First he had Brom, then Murtagh. He didn't survive A SINGLE FREAKING DAY by himself and I am to believe he's the grand hero the world is waiting for. For me, Brom was the real MVP, without Brom, Eragon would know nothing and I'm not exaggerating one bit. Even though I liked Brom, every time he would open his mouth and I realised it was another humongous part of exposition, I died a little inside.

All in all, I think it's clear I won't be continuing with the series.",followed goodreads updates book already know like expecting like tbh heard good things ready epic tale full adventure dragons boy wrong first writing style makes book hard read exposition unreal book exposition felt reading story within story understand readers need context believe could done differently almost died boredom action scenes compared portion characters talking traveling talking main boy eragon stupid back statement let start fact decide find uncle murderers kill without battle training sense direction monsters pursuing decided try kill magic training days almost killed went temple knowing might meet bad guys even though supposed incognito utterly surprised found almost killed prison cell complaining food good enough soldiers making noise would let rest broke hand falling rock need say believe even author knew eragon would useless alone see eragon anything whole page novel first brom murtagh survive single freaking day believe grand hero world waiting brom real mvp without brom eragon would know nothing exaggerating one bit even though liked brom every time would open mouth realised another humongous part exposition died little inside think clear wo continuing series,True,Negative,Positive

And to think the author wrote this book when he was only 16 (published at age 20)! This story takes us over mountains, through vast cities, enemy towers, deep underground and more! And Saphira is one of the most characterized dragons I have ever read about. You cannot help but love her majestic character! Now, upon re-reading this I must admit that there a few dull moments that drag on too long for no reason but for the most part I can overlook them.

Eragon is just a simple farm boy, struggling with his uncle and cousin just to get through yet another winter. Not for much longer! When a dragon hatches and his home destroyed, Eragon must forge a new path for himself. Eragon's character is very much a teen boy. Impulsive, a bit angry and he gets into trouble time after time again. Saphira is wise beyond her tender young age and almost mothering of Eragon. I love seeing their relationship unfold. My favorite character though is the mysterious Brom. He likes to keep his secrets and all I wanted to do was grab him and shake them out!

the writing is quite descriptive and can seem a bit lengthy to those who just like the book to fly by. With this, pause and think, maybe even refer to the map at the beginning. The story is richly built, stone by stone (so to speak) around us. I could clearly envision every moment of this story and that is something I love in a good fantasy.

Along the way I read so many mean, petty reviews of Eragon, criticism of Paolini's teenage writing that really step to far. (If you don't like fantasy, maybe read another genre.) I don't know... it's really a pretty good book, why have so many people been upset about it?

Anyway here's my controversial hot take:
-Eragon as a character is a dumbass, he is too self-aware, egocentric, and... acts exactly how a self-absorbed teenager acts when struggling to find a place in the world and just beginning to conceptualize experiences, morality, and form new relationships in the wake of trauma. He is strikingly well-written when you really think about it.
-Saphira is great no more needs to be said.
-Brom is way more of a mess than I remembered him as...
-Arya spends most of the book asleep but that doesn't bother me so much because at least she isn't the only female character in this book, we have Angela, Saphira, and the little bits of Nasuada.
-Murtagh is the barest outline of so much more and I wish there could have been perspective chapters on him right from the start, in fact for as long as the book is, and for the type of story being told, the limit to Eragon's perspective is so confining and narrow, I would want to see scenes of Durza, the Ra'zac, and more-- replacing some of the slower parts of Eragon's journey.
-I think that Paolini's plucking of elements from other stories not a fault but a creative way of mixing familiarity with originality.

I mean, yes he took the story of Star Wars (not hecking original to begin with), put it in a world directly copied from Tolkien, used character names and themes from ASOIAF (as well as likely ideas drawn from McCaffrey and other sci-fi and fantasy authors). I don't see this as bad, I see this as mashup fanfiction refined into a collage of recognizable and fresh elements that form a world both comfortably nostalgic for fantasy lovers and with added originality and moderately more diversity than the works it draws upon. It is an exploration of tropes and themes of the hero's journey.

Yes his writing voice was not fully matured and I will have to see the development and growth as I chew through the rest of the series, but I don't think that's a problem?

(I’ll have all my thoughts spoiler free, and then some spoilery ones after.)
First of all, halfway through reading this, I found out that Paolini was 15 or something when he had written this, which is super cool, although it also shows…. This book was very heavily influenced by LOTR, I haven’t read it yet, and I’m looking forward to, especially after reading this. And it gets a lot of criticism for that reason, but I think it’s fine if he continues his own stories and twists to it in, which I heard he does in the sequels.
I personally really enjoyed being with these characters, and had fun reading about their adventures, well… most of the time…
I was really connected to the characters quite quickly, and I LOVED the animals in this book, I loved the dragon (this isn’t a spoiler, it’s in the premise) Sphira and the way she talks, she was my fav character although I also loved Eragon. There are some great funny and feelgood moments in this book, some exciting battle moments, and some sad ones that I really appreciated!
I came into this blind, I actually thought Eragon was the name of a dragon because of the cover, I didn’t even read what is says on the back until the middle of the book. And I was surprised for good and for bad by many things…
My main criticisms:
--- PACING!!!! Omg I would have cut out a lot of this book! This book is (?) pages long, and I think that was soooo unnecessary, there are big chunks of this book that I think are so boring, actually not the beginning, Paolini took his time at the beginning to introduce the characters etc. and I appreciated that, it actually in the middle where I would cut out, there’s just a lot of traveling and talking with someone I HATED, but we’ll get to that in a sec… I just think that this book was way too stretched out and could have used a little more editing. (I think I’m exaggerating a little bit here, it just had like a hundred to two-hundred pages I would cut out, but some of the slow parts I did like…)
--- Dialogue; Sometimes I feel like the dialogue between some characters was unrealistic, I don’t have examples, unfortunately, because I didn’t annotate the book, but I feel that sometimes the wording choices were a little bit off, especially for a sixteen-year-old! It sometimes felt like Eragon was talking as if he were trying to talk like an old man, and it was pretty weird…

--- I don’t even know how to put this in one word without a spoiler (I’ll talk about it in the spoiler section) but all I’ll say is that there was a really important character who I HATED a lot, and it really annoyed me sometimes….Overall, I would recommend this book, and it really does get better with the sequel…. which I will one day, review…)
Now, on to the spoiler section!
Spoiler
So, I really loved (in a weird way) the fact that Garrow died, because one, it obviously started the plot, two, I really like that weird scene with Sphira when she just left and we didn’t really know what was going on, and when we came back to the farm, it was really sad and I felt for Eragon, three, this is what made me realise I was attached to these characters! I remember feeling really satisfied after I read Garrow’s death, because I realised that in only a hundred pages or even less (I think) he really made me love Eragon and be angry, sad and confused with him…
I think what made those hundred pages that I would have cut out so tiering for me, is that they were mostly dialogue with Brom! I HATED Brom! I’m not even exactly sure why… I don’t know, I just hated his character… To me, he felt unrealistic, annoying, overly aggressive, and inconsistent! He would say he’s really weak, and then he would do something really hard! He would say something’s really dangerous and that they need to use it only when they really have to, and then he’d use it for something as small as making a fire, again, I didn’t annotate the book, so I don’t have an example, but I just really didn’t enjoy his character, and therefore, was even sort of happy when he died, not that I necessarily wanted him to die, I just wanted him out of the story… I also thought it was SO OBVIOUS he was a rider! I honestly couldn’t figure out why Eragon didn’t see it! I figured that out when he was explaining to him about riders, and although out the book, those “hints” just confirmed it more and more (like, he would say he didn’t want to talk about how he knew all about dragons, riders and magic…), and by the time he almost died, I thought he wasn’t cos they didn’t officially confirm it yet…
I really loved that ending with the Varden, and I think the second book picked up so much more!
I have some more critassms but most of them are very light and so I wouldn’t want to be that specific and to say every little thing I didn’t like, or, they’re much stronger in the second book that I’ll talk about it then…
Overall, I would recommend this book, and it really does get better with the sequel…. which I will one day, review…)",read three months ago mixed thoughts spoiler free spoilery ones first halfway reading found paolini something written super cool although also book heavily influenced lotr read yet looking forward especially reading gets lot criticism reason think fine continues stories twists heard sequels personally really enjoyed characters fun reading adventures really connected characters quite quickly loved animals book loved dragon spoiler premise sphira way talks fav character although also loved eragon great funny feelgood moments book exciting battle moments sad ones really appreciated came blind actually thought eragon name dragon cover even read says back middle book surprised good bad many main criticisms pacing omg would cut lot book book pages long think soooo unnecessary big chunks book think boring actually beginning paolini took time beginning introduce characters etc appreciated actually middle would cut lot traveling talking someone hated get think book way stretched could used little editing think exaggerating little bit like hundred pages would cut slow parts dialogue sometimes feel like dialogue characters unrealistic examples unfortunately annotate book feel sometimes wording choices little bit especially sometimes felt like eragon talking trying talk like old man pretty even know put one word without spoiler talk spoiler section say really important character hated lot really annoyed would recommend book really get better one day spoiler section spoiler really loved weird way fact garrow died one obviously started plot two really like weird scene sphira left really know going came back farm really sad felt eragon three made realise attached characters remember feeling really satisfied read garrow death realised hundred pages even less think really made love eragon angry sad confused think made hundred pages would cut tiering mostly dialogue brom hated brom even exactly sure know hated felt unrealistic annoying overly aggressive inconsistent would say really weak would something really hard would say something really dangerous need use really use something small making fire annotate book example really enjoy character therefore even sort happy died necessarily wanted die wanted also thought obvious rider honestly figure eragon see figured explaining riders although book hints confirmed like would say want talk knew dragons riders time almost died thought cos officially confirm really loved ending varden think second book picked much critassms light want specific say every little thing like much stronger second book talk overall would recommend book really get better one day,True,Positive,Positive

But I’ll say that I think it was a very GOOD book. I think the plot was well done and I don’t mind the similarities it has to Lord of the Rings, for example.
I enjoyed myself while reading Eragon and a thing I really appreciate is that it didn’t feel unnecessarily long or slow for me, even though this is a >700 page book (in German at least).

Christopher Paolini seems promising. He begins Eragon's story with just a simple farm boy's life. Unfortunately for Eragon, his mother died a long time ago, leaving him with his Uncle Garrow when he was a baby. She never told Garrow who his father was. So this young orphan is hunting in a dangerous wooded area--- The Spine --- when he happens to come across a strangely polished blue stone. He then tries to sell it to no avail. He then takes it to an expert who says it is hollow. When the expert (Merlock) takes the flat edge of a sword to the stone, it rings clearly, which proves that it is hollow. Garrow, Eragon and Garrow's son, Roran, all return to their farm. It is not until Eragon wakes up in the middle of the night (for absolutely no reason) that the stone starts cracking. When all the violent cracking of the stone stops--- There is a dragon, about the length of one of Eragon's arms(try stretching out your arm and imagining a dragon like that *shudder*) . He realizes that it's a dragon egg, and decides not to tell anyone for the sake of his Uncle, cousin, and the dragon that just hatched. You see, there is a king in the country of Alagaesia, named Galbatorix. He was once a dragon rider, and still considers himself one, not that he deserves it. Not that he's a real king--- He's totally and irrevocably evil beyond words (How Paolini achieved that, i have absolutely no idea).
 So Eragon takes care of the *tiny* dragon until it is able to fend for itself. He feeds it meat (I believe he does this only once?) and then it learns to hunt. Later on, it is revealed that the dragon had been in the egg for a century, waiting for the right person to come along---(Whoops i'm getting ahead of myself.) So the dragon hides from the townspeople in a tree until it starts to speak to Eragon in his mind. He hears the dragon calling his name. Then, later on, he goes to the storyteller, Brom, and asks for a dragon story. Brom tells Eragon the story of ""how the Riders began, why they were so highly regarded, and where dragons came from.""(Actual excerpt from Eragon) So as Brom is telling him about all this, Eragon interrupts with many questions. After the tale, Eragon asks about dragon names. He then goes to the dragon and asks it if it likes a couple of dragon names, though they are all male. He then realizes (finally) that the dragon is a girl (I knew that.)and asks her if she likes Saphira (Suh-FEAR-uh) and she says yes. And so, they went on adventures, Brom eventually figuring out Eragon is a rider, and joining them. I won't spill everything.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,1.0,"Jeez... I MEAN... JEEZ, GUYS.

I'm not gonna say I don't understand how some people could enjoy, like, even love this book. THAT DOES NOT MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE CALL IT ""GOOD"". It is not! It's not a good book! And for some reason... Eragon fans refuse to admit that?

What I mean when I say I understand how some people can love this book is that I understand how books read during childhood are hard to shake. Kids read bad books! And like them! And that is 100% cool! I would never discourage a child, y'know ages 7-17, who says their favorite book is Eragon. I would say, ""That's so cool, so you really like dragons, huh?"" and the kid would probably say, ""Hell yeah,"" because when you publish a children's/teen's fantasy book with a G.D. dragon on the cover, you're gonna bring in the dragon-kid audience.

We all read shitty books when we were kids and teens! I would wander the aisles at the library and read literally any book with a unicorn on the front. Or a mermaid! I read every godforsaken unicorn and mermaid book in the Children's section of my library and, cross my heart and hope to die, I can't think of one which I would call ""good"" today. I enjoyed them and loved reading them as a kid! I would never not ever recommend to my grown adult friends to read any of them!

I read Maximum Ride in middle school. The first book was good, I'll say that; new and fresh and funny. The rest of them... truly heinous. Seventh grade me, though? I could have wrestled a blue whale with the strength of my love for Maximum Ride. I loved and cherished every single book in that series. Were they good, though? You're asking me, 21-year-old Avah if the Maximum Ride series was good? It wasn't. Maybe the first one, but the rest I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

Now, I've proven that I understand the thrall of childhood nostalgia. Things you like as a kid are difficult to see without the eyes of a child. But... y'all... Eragon does not deserve that loyalty!

This book made me want to be illiterate! I wanted to forget that Eragon existed and never have to encounter it in the wild! I would rather insult K-poppers on twitter and get doxxed than read this book. It was comically bad in the first 60 pages, then it became tedious, and then it became fully torturous.

I started this book, and realized in about 20 pages, ""Oh, this is the unholy, bastard child of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, isn't it?"" (It is). It was so bald-facedly lifted from those two works that, at one point in the beginning I thought, ""The only thing keeping this from becoming A New Hope is the uncle character burning to death."" ..........................and then guess what happened.

A big complaint with this book is the overuse, and abuse, of fantasy tropes. This is not just the ""hero's journey"" archetype, it's a shoddy facsimile of better works, filtered through the mind and pen of a child. But that's not what truly makes this book so painful to read. Readers honestly couldn't give a crap if a trope has been done before, we only care when it's been done better before. And the parts that could have been better or new were... very not.

The writing, to begin with, was what you'd expect of a teenager writing their first novel. The sheer number of unnecessary adjectives made every sentence an exercise in superhuman patience. I wasn’t counting, but I’m pretty sure he used the word “glistening” more times that the word “said”. THAT’S NOT GOOD WRITING!! Using “said” after 90% of dialogue is not repetitive, that’s like saying you can’t end 90% of sentences with a period. THAT’S JUST HOW WRITING IS DONE! Because if you’re always trying to innovate how you end your sentences… Suddenly- the reader is no longer paying attention to the actual words in your review of a 18 year old book; they’re wondering why you’re refusing to end your sentences with a period?! And it stops making sense entirely-

And then this quite painful writing was paired with this specific “plot”. I put that in quotations because I’m gonna try to give you a brief rundown but I’m not sure I remember the whole plot. Basically: Mysterious prologue where a lady carrying a mysterious package is ambushed and captured. Lady magicks away her package to a place I can’t remember the name of, but that’s where Eragon lives with his uncle and cousin. Some interesting townspeople characters are introduced and then abandoned for the rest of the book. We meet a weird old man who acts very weirdly around Eragon. The lady’s package is an egg, and the egg hatches and makes friends with Eragon, and they can read each other's minds. Some people come into town, they’re evil, they want the dragon, they kill Eragon’s uncle, Eragon flees town with the weird old man. He wants revenge on the people who killed his uncle! And he wants to make sure they don’t kill his cousin, who moved away or something. These two motives are discussed twice in 150 pages and then never again. The old man actually knows Magick and teaches Eragon as they wander the wilds. They go to a town, meet a witch, there’s… some sort of conflict I honestly can’t remember, but the old man dies. Eragon meets a new friend who seems way cooler than Eragon right off the bat, and together they break the girl of Eragon’s dreams out of jail. (That’s the lady from the prologue). They FINALLY meet the antagonist (?) of the novel. This is at least halfway through the book. They try to heal the lady, who’s an elf, natch, and they take her to a mountain in which a secret alliance of men and dwarves lives. They hang out in the mountain for some time, Eragon’s new friend’s tragic backstory is revealed, but doesn’t actually seem that important after that. There’s a big battle in the mountain. Eragon saves the day! He receives a scar on his back and gets REALLY REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT, AND CALLS HIMSELF “DISFIGURED”. He vows to go someplace, I don’t really know where. Fin.

That’s what happens in the book. Why? I do not know. There was very little reason for anything in this book to happen. I get why he had to flee… and that he wanted revenge n stuff… but he didn’t ever actually do stuff about that? I could be mistaken. A lot of things and choices in this book were explained in one line of dialogue or less, so maybe I missed it. It’s very possible.

I get it. This is a book for kids. It was written by a kid! But you cannot look at me and tell me that children's & teen's books can get away with being not good. Bad kid's books are still bad books! And this one happens to be one of the worst! If this book makes you happy, go ahead. I will not stop you! I encourage you! Most things in the world suck super bad, so if one thing makes you happy, I'm happy for you.

If you are thinking of picking this book up for the first time, though... Put it down. Back away. I am holding a broomstick and I will not hesitate to smack you down if you reach for this book. There are better things out there for you.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,5.0,"So I first read this while I was in undergrad. A boyfriend lent me book and I had no idea what it was about or that it was only the first book in a series. I just told him that I enjoyed Lord of the Rings, and he said Eragon was ""Lord of the Rings Lite"".

And I suppose in some ways, that's true. You can definitely see that Paolini was inspired by Tolkien throughout this novel.

It follows a young farm boy named Eragon as he finds a mysterious stone in the woods. The stone, it turns out, is actually an egg. A dragon egg. Eragon becomes the first dragon rider in something like 100 years and by doing so enters himself into a war between the King Galbatorix (a dangerous dragon rider in his own right) and the rebels, made up of elves, dwarves and men. He must choose a side and become a warrior for their cause.

For me this book was an easy read, one that kept me turning the pages, even when the parts were slow. I was left with questions and desire to pick up the next book in the series. It does read a bit... young though. Maybe because Paolini was so young when he first published this book (later books in the series definitely show Paolini's growth as a writer).

If you like Lord of the Rings, but are wary of such a huge commitment, I suggest picking this one up and giving it a whirl. It's a fun adventure and a good introduction to higher fantasy stories.",first read undergrad boyfriend lent book idea first book series told enjoyed lord rings said eragon lord rings lite suppose ways true definitely see paolini inspired tolkien throughout novel follows young farm boy named eragon finds mysterious stone woods stone turns actually egg dragon egg eragon becomes first dragon rider something like years enters war king galbatorix dangerous dragon rider right rebels made elves dwarves men must choose side become warrior cause book easy read one kept turning pages even parts slow left questions desire pick next book series read bit young though maybe paolini young first published book later books series definitely show paolini growth writer like lord rings wary huge commitment suggest picking one giving whirl fun adventure good introduction higher fantasy stories,True,Positive,Positive

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.0,"My feelings about this book are very mixed. I know that this is the first installment of this series, but it was boring most of the time.

LIKES:
~ Saphira, and Eragon's communication with her. I must say the only reason I started this series so late in my life is the dragon, I just wanted a good dragon book.
~ Brom. I enjoyed all of his stories and lessons, and I must say it made me satisfied when he put Eragon in his place (Let's all agree on the fact that Eragon is a little brat). I think Brom is the only character I liked from this book. (And maybe Murtagh, he seems somewhat interesting, but I think his character will be developed more in the next book).
Spoiler
And even though I knew that Brom will die very soon, I was spoiled for that, I must say that I was a bit sad when it happened. And not so much for the death itself, but for the way it was done. I didn't like that at all, I think his death is the same as the death of Eragon's uncle (I forgot his name). The only thing that moved me was what Saphira had done. I think that was beautiful (and a little creepy, I wouldn't like to see a dead man through a crystal haha)
~ Angela and Solembum, I just wanted to add them here because I was delighted every time they appeared in the book, and I think they were an interesting touch to it.
~ Tronjheim. Yes, it gave me a lot of LOTR flashbacks, and I must admit that that could be the main reason I liked the descriptions of this hidden town, but I think it was presented to us beautifully. And I think that the time they had entered the city the plot started to develop at last.
~ The Twins and their powers were pretty interesting to me, I think we will definitely see them in the future.

DISLIKES:
~ ERAGON. Ughhhhhh I was so annoyed by him most of the time. I get it, he is young, and he is learning, but must he be so stupid???? If someone says that you shouldn't use magic before you learn to control it, YOU SHOULDN'T USE MAGIC. Simple as that. Idiot.
~ The plot. Omg, it was so boring and dragging so much I was thinking about quitting this book. We get two pages of action, fighting, something happening and then 150 pages of horse riding and talking about the future plans.
~ The fighting scenes. In my opinion, they were too short and badly done. It was like this:
1) Someone is coming to fight Eragon and (__)
2) Eragon tells Saphira to hide
3) Boom! POW!
4) Saphira is too far to help
5) Eragon uses magic and doesn't know how to control his powers
6) Eragon is unconscious
7) He wakes up a few days later
You really don't need to read every fight scene. Just read the first one, they are all the same.
~ And I didn't like that that idiot doesn't know what he wants to do now. He is a Rider now, strong and powerful, but he is too stupid for all of that. I hate when the motivation in books is the death of someone close
Spoiler
In this case, Eragon's uncle and later on Brom, but I would like for the main character to have at least that kind of motivation. In the beginning, he wants to find Ra'zac. (I forgot to say I hate that we didn't get any other information about them, WHAT ARE THEY??) Ok, but what will you, a 16yo boy, do when you find them? You couldn't stand a minute in a fight with them
Spoiler
, which was proven later in the book.
After that, you want to go to the Varden, and you don't think what will you do there, you just want to go there.


I don't know. I must say that it took me about a month to read this book. A MONTH! I can't remember the last time I read a book for that long.
I don't really know if I want to continue with this series. Maybe in the future, when I have nothing else to read, but I doubt it. I understand that this is the first book and that the next ones will probably be better, but I can feel all of the horse riding and doing nothing in them as well.

Now, almost 20 years have passed and don't remember many details, but I clearly remember that when I finished Eragon I was left with a true WTF feeling, and I still regard this as one of the very worst books I've ever read.

This could be a good summary - it was a review of the Eragon movie, but it works for the book too: ""Kids too young for Lord Of The Rings may be distracted by this below average fantasy, but for everyone else this is derivative and silly. Swap dragon riders with the Jedi, Galbatorix with Darth Vader, Brom with Obi-Wan and what have you got? Plagiarism.""

I can't say this was the best fantasy book ever. in my opinion it was good I enjoyed the action scenes alot and I love all the characters. The reason I took down stars was because I didn't particularly like the writing style and thought it made the book difficult to read, and there was some time skipping and then you weren't given a summary of what happened in that time. Which I didnt really like.
I did really enjoy the swordfight scenes and like I said the action scenes were pretty epic.

**minor spoilers ahead*


one problem I encountered in the end was eragon killed the shade durza, more urgals were alive than dwarves, elves and humans (which were on eragon side) yet eragons side still ultimately ended up winning which sort of made sense but I felt like even though im not an urgal supporter they had won. Also can we talk about Galbatorix (I'm pretty sure I spelt his name wrong sorry) he wasn't that great of a villain it might be me or its early in the series but he never actually did anything, which made him seem more like someone to move the plot device than a actual villain.

Why does this book read like it was written by a fantasy-obsessed 15-year-old? Oh, nevermind... Is THAT why is has EVERY single one moth-eaten fantasy cliché???
It's like Paolini actually, in all seriousness, used Diana Wynne Jones' humorous [b:The Tough Guide to Fantasyland|47510|The Tough Guide to Fantasyland|Diana Wynne Jones|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1348653215s/47510.jpg|1044747] as a real technical manual on how to create the Eragon universe. And the proud parents of a budding ""new Tolkien"", instead of proudly allowing him to read it out loud at family gatherings, decided to publish it and unleash it upon the world.

*

LEFT - the ride that this story promises to take you on. RIGHT - what you actually get.

The only way to actually enjoy Eragon is if you have never encountered a single fantasy-related story in your life (and that includes ""Star Wars"", by the way). Let's have a roll call for the clichés, shall we? A mysterious talented orphan/poor farm boy? Check. Dragons? Check. Elves and dwarves? Check. Stew? Check. Ancient sword? Check. The weird apostrophe-ridden names (save the protagonists, of course?) Check. A quest? Check. Hot chick Damsel in distress? Check. And it goes on and on and on... Wait, you say, maybe Paolini was deliberately paying homage to the traditions of the fantasy genre. Fine. I suppose that could explain some of it. But still, blindly and straightforwardly rehashing of the old tropes without adding much originality IS NOT OKAY, okay?

I think that the writing is immature and betrays the author's young age and lack of experience. Throughout the novel, Paolini clumsily brings our attention to anything that he considers important to the story with constant reminders and brick-sized hints. Foreshadowing should be subtle, but I don't think he quite grasps that concept. The descriptions are trying too hard to be Tolkien-like, but fail at this miserably. His attempts at creating accents and dialects are pathetic. There were quite a few instances when I had to shake my head muttering, ""I don't think this word means what you think it does"". The prose is stilted and quite irritating while trying to be overly pretentious.

OH, I SEE...


The characters are flat and devoid of any believable personality, with shallow and simplistic motivations that only exist to move the plot forward. The interactions between them are far-fetched and forced. The protagonist (Paolini's version of Luke Skywalker), absolutely marvelous at so many cool things with minimal training (every child's dream) is there for the reader to self-insert into the story. The deux-ex-machina bits replace so many actual solutions in this story that no amount of eyerolling would suffice. And the plot holes - the story is so full of those there's barely any plot left at all. As for the worldbuilding - well, he stuffs it with every imaginable fantasy trope, as I mentioned before. Ughhhh. And yet at the end nothing is memorable.
""Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world.""
The first sentence alone should have stopped me from reading this book. I should have reorganized my sock drawer instead.

He did mature over the course of the book and by the end he started to grow on me, which was nice to see, but he annoyed me for over half of the book.

Like, ok. It's jut Star Wars in LOTR wrapping, right? Everyone knows that. But Star Wars itself is pretty basic hero's journey stuff, so I don't think it's really fair to knock this serious because it's so formulaic. Lots of people (including me) find a lot of value in formulaic genre stories and if something is written well, the originality of the plot is actually pretty irrelevant. Blah blah all stories have already been told blah. You get it.

Where this story falls flat for me rests solidly on the way two characters are written - Eragon and Arya.

Eragon is an author-insert, a Mary Sue, a Chosen one, and a very boring protagonist. He doesn't really have any personality and what he has is pretty inconsistent. (Was anyone else troubled by his speech patterns? Like, super casual most of the time and can't read, but then is super eloquent when needed?) He just seems really flat and as far as I remember, that doesn't really improve in the next books. His cries to the heavens and assorted ""why me???""s are so ridiculous and even the audiobook narrator can't seem to take it seriously.

And Arya. Whoo boy. She's just written like a Tokien-fan wet dream. She has no personality besides ""perfect"" and if the author spends any more time describing her beauty (and I know he will) it is going to drive me mad. Her dialogue is always very exposition-heavy and she is just Generally Powerful and Good at Everything. Usually, I like competence in female characters, but when it isn't paired with a personality, it moves from good representation to objectification. She's the perfect Princess Warrior Magic Elf Lady and the male gaze is just dripping from the pages. It's so icky.

So, I'm going to keep re-reading the series because I'm a completionist and I don't remember much about the other books, so I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

Eragon ignited my love for many things. Fantasy (apart from Harry Potter, I hadn't read much of it), dragons, and badass elves. This book had everything. I tore through the rest of the series equally as quick. As such, I barely seemed to remember any of it. So I broke out my fancy leather edition and got started reading. Not only did I want to, but it provided me with comfort and nostalgia.

I'd truly forgotten most of the events that took place in this book. My memory of it was skeletal. Much of this book, surprisingly, was spent traveling. Traveling and learning. It wasn't as battle heavy as I remembered it being (though if memory serves, which it might not, the rest of the books are explosive enough that it doesn't matter). Despite that, the book didn't drag in any way. It's a journey! And it excited me, journeying with Eragon and Saphira again. Seeing Brom, one of my favorite characters ever, in all his glory. Reliving all the painful bits that I knew would come but had forgotten how. I'd completely forgotten who Murtagh was, so that was fun. And Arya. Arya began my love for the elves. No other elf can hold a candle to her. She's a true badass. I remembered there being more of her than there actually was in this book, but I know her role expands in the following books, prompting the desire to continue rereading the series. I'd also forgotten we don't see much more of Nausada until the following books, but even that little bit with her reminded me how strong and powerful a character she is.

I loved the bond between Saphira and Eragon. I loved Saphira's snarky conversation and the banter the two shared. I loved watching Eragon grow into a young man, gaining skill and confidence as he went, as well as a deep devotion to his cause and an even greater love for his dragon. Like I said, it was a journey.

As I read the book, it reminded me of little bits and pieces that come in the following books. A bit of clever foreshadowing and strange associations I probably made on my part. But that was an exciting feeling.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.0,"I received this as a birthday present when I was very young, and a while later fell in love with it. Was excited for and saw the film with my mother (then nearly walked out halfway through it, but that didn't deter my love for the source material). I fell out of love with the series by the time book 3 came out, but still pushed through book 4 for completion's sake. Decided to reread these, given Paolini's recent (and planned future) releases, especially since I never reread them after book 3 came out and people my age, for some reason, tell me they ""still"" hold up.

In short, no, book 1 at least does not. I mean I love my fair bit of garbage, but no.

There are insufficient words for how excruciatingly terrible this book is. I know lots of us look back at this with nostalgia, and probably haven't re-read it in 15 or more years, which does color perception, and perhaps the rest of us just really love anything with dragons (particularly blue ones) and rangers and magic, but good grief. Much of this book is repetition and a sense of… heaviness. Too much to say what is honestly not much at all.

Mixing metaphors, wordiness, overuse of random and completely unnecessary similes (“Before him lay Palancar Valley, exposed like an unrolled map.” Yes, it's weird how looking at a landscape from a distance is like staring at a map... wonder why that is), bizarre images, and weirdly specific and placed details: “her deep eyes shone with a driving force. Her clothes were unadorned, yet her beauty was undiminished.” What driving force? Her clothing is unadorned with what? Jewelry? Embroidery? Yes, people who don’t wear those things can look good. Shocking, I know. The story is full of that. It’s honestly tiring. A single half-decent editor could have neatened up most of this, but I guess Paolini's parents didn't want to crush his spirits by putting him through that when they owned the company selling the novel.

Quite frankly, a lot of these sentences don’t even make sense. How is smoke from a chimney “defiant” of a forest? It stands out among trees, I guess, but is the idea “oh it’s shocking that there can be a fire in a forest without setting the forest on fire” or some vague and unnecessary remark about human civilization within a forest? “Few traveled here except merchants and trappers.” Yes??? Who else would travel there??? It’s a village out in some random valley, not Disneyworld???

I suppose Paolini somehow accomplishes communicating the idea of what you’re supposed to be staring at if you’re familiar with fantasy or have seen some version of “The Lord of the Rings”, so you can gloss over just how hard every. single. sentence. is. to. read. I could quote every single sentence in this book. It is a physically painful read that would make you go cross-eyed. It's literally giving me a headache.

Eragon himself
Spoiler
is the worst character in the story. He's not compelling. He's not fun. He's not compassionate. He's not funny. He's not smart, which wouldn't be a problem as a character who's meant to be coming into this from a lack of knowledge and then to learn things; he's randomly extremely ""intelligent"" without a backstory to justify it, and then stupid again for bizarre reasons. His arrogance isn't interesting to watch, because he's only ever rewarded, never taught how he's wrong. At one point he discovers slavery, is angry about it existing, and his solution is to hope a pickpocket tries to steal from him so he can beat the person up. Despite his rage at even the thought of slavers, at one point when he and Murtagh are fighting them, Eragon thinks ""if they run, I'll let them go"", and when Murtagh kills one, Eragon is about it. To the point that from that point he doesn't trust Murtagh, considers him merciless, and says that Murtagh has to for killing a who was . The second worst character in the story is Saphira, whose main issue is being omnipotent (kind of), and then also equally arrogant, a deux ex machina who doesn't do useful things, and also pretty stupid, which is fine, since she's young and meant to learn, but she doesn't really learn? She's just arrogant about it, insulting to Eragon (which wouldn't really encourage him to get better?) and just generally mean. But her territoriality over Eragon is kind of funny to watch, so there's that, I guess? It doesn't help that the weird way Paolini sometimes has the characters talk is always worse with her.

The rest of the cast isn't terrible, they're just varying degrees of stupid by and large. Arya is the smartest one, followed by Murtagh, then Brom. Brom/Obi-Wan Kenobi/Gandalf is just weirdly closed-off for no good reason, randomly gets drunk with a 15-year-old, and is really rude to his friend's wife because she has the audacity to be annoyed at freeloaders in her own house. Murtagh is the best character in the story, honestly, and far too nice to Eragon. But their friendship is kind of cute - despite Eragon being manipulative and awful, generally - so whatever. It's the one bright spot in the story, I guess.

The magic system is stolen from ""The Earthsea Cycle"". Most of the plot is stolen from ""Star Wars: Episode IV"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"". A good chunk of Elvish lore is also from LOTR, and a good chunk of dragon lore is from a mix of ""The Earthsea Cycle"" and apparently ""Dragonriders of Pern"". Paolini does nothing good with any of this. He just mashes it together with some of the worst writing I've seen, and rides high off of coming out the same year ""The Two Towers"", ""Chamber of Secrets"", and ""Star Wars: Episode II"" did.

If you take away everything that is bad about this: the writing, the characterization, the pacing, and even much of the plot, what you get is basically ""dragon + ranger fight bad dude"", and you can see that 10,000x elsewhere. It's not worth the slog of this series. Yes, he was young and it was his first novel. But quite frankly there are authors older or around his age who write on similar topics who can actually write and write phenomenally who will never get even an ounce of the attention this incredibly garbage bookstopper gets for being lucky enough to be written by the child of folks who own a publishing company.

Quite frankly, if you can find it, Eragon Sporkings did a better job of pointing out many of the problems in this series bit by bit than I ever could. I don't have the strength to go that far. Do not read this. Do not recommend it to your children. Do not buy it for anyone. If you want YA fantasy about dragons, magic, and adventures, read Patricia Wrede's ""The Enchanted Forest Chronicles"". If you want adult fantasy for the same, read Steven Brust's ""Vlad Taltos"" books (technically they're not dragons, but they're dragon-like creatures). If you want queer magic fantasy with dragons, read TJ Klune's ""The Lightning-Struck Heart"" or Noelle Stevenson's ""Nimona"". If you want animated dragons, watch ""Spirited Away"" or ""Yona of the Dawn"". Or just read anything he stole ideas from, like ""The Earthsea Cycle"". And if you don't want my advice, just google ""YA dragons"" and I'm sure there are TONS of modern YA stories featuring dragons that are far, far better than this, and even more that just deal with magic.",received birthday present young later fell love excited saw film mother nearly walked halfway deter love source material fell love series time book came still pushed book completion sake decided reread given paolini recent planned future releases especially since never reread book came people age reason tell still hold short book least mean love fair bit garbage insufficient words excruciatingly terrible book know lots us look back nostalgia probably years color perception perhaps rest us really love anything dragons particularly blue ones rangers magic good grief much book repetition sense heaviness much say honestly much mixing metaphors wordiness overuse random completely unnecessary similes lay palancar valley exposed like unrolled yes weird looking landscape distance like staring map wonder bizarre images weirdly specific placed details deep eyes shone driving force clothes unadorned yet beauty driving force clothing unadorned jewelry embroidery yes people wear things look good shocking know story full honestly tiring single editor could neatened guess paolini parents want crush spirits putting owned company selling novel quite frankly lot sentences even make sense smoke chimney defiant forest stands among trees guess idea oh shocking fire forest without setting forest fire vague unnecessary remark human civilization within forest traveled except merchants yes else would travel village random valley disneyworld suppose paolini somehow accomplishes communicating idea supposed staring familiar fantasy seen version lord rings gloss hard every single sentence read could quote every single sentence book physically painful read would make go literally giving headache eragon spoiler worst character story compelling fun compassionate funny smart would problem character meant coming lack knowledge learn things randomly extremely intelligent without backstory justify stupid bizarre reasons arrogance interesting watch ever rewarded never taught wrong one point discovers slavery angry existing solution hope pickpocket tries steal beat person despite rage even thought slavers one point murtagh fighting eragon thinks run let go murtagh kills one eragon point point trust murtagh considers merciless says murtagh killing second worst character story saphira whose main issue omnipotent kind also equally arrogant deux ex machina useful things also pretty stupid fine since young meant learn really learn arrogant insulting eragon would really encourage get better generally mean territoriality eragon kind funny watch guess help weird way paolini sometimes characters talk always worse rest cast terrible varying degrees stupid large arya smartest one followed murtagh brom weirdly good reason randomly gets drunk really rude friend wife audacity annoyed freeloaders house murtagh best character story honestly far nice eragon friendship kind cute despite eragon manipulative awful generally whatever one bright spot story guess magic system stolen earthsea cycle plot stolen star wars episode iv lord rings good chunk elvish lore also lotr good chunk dragon lore mix earthsea cycle apparently dragonriders pern paolini nothing good mashes together worst writing seen rides high coming year two towers chamber secrets star wars episode ii take away everything bad writing characterization pacing even much plot get basically dragon ranger fight bad dude see elsewhere worth slog series yes young first novel quite frankly authors older around age write similar topics actually write write phenomenally never get even ounce attention incredibly garbage bookstopper gets lucky enough written child folks publishing company quite frankly find eragon sporkings better job pointing many problems series bit bit ever could strength go far read recommend children buy anyone want ya fantasy dragons magic adventures read patricia wrede enchanted forest chronicles want adult fantasy read steven brust vlad taltos books technically dragons creatures want queer magic fantasy dragons read tj klune heart noelle stevenson nimona want animated dragons watch spirited away yona dawn read anything stole ideas like earthsea cycle want advice google ya dragons sure tons modern ya stories featuring dragons far far better even deal magic,True,Negative,Positive

Where the content of those may not be entirely appropriate, and likewise the plots of those involve more complexity.

Its not to say this is not complex. It's just an age appropriate read, and for adults a lighter read. I just recently put the second one on my TBR list.

George Lucas and JRR Tolkein are/were no strangers to the idea either. Quit making stupid comments about how this author stole from that author. The hero's journey has been in existence since the Iliad and Odyssey and if you know the formula, you can write any plot line.

What interested me the most was the ""about the author"" at the end in which it stated that it was the parent's publishing company that initially published the book. I can understand why. No one wants to tarnish the star of their own child and say something really isn't that good.

Eragon isn't a bad story, but it is no different than every other adventure/fantasy book out there because no matter how you slice it, they all follow the Hero's Journey in the end. It is, after all, nothing special.

This adventure story was definitely far more then expected. It was more YA, then children's, really. The first half fit more in the to the genre of children's, then the second half. Although Eragon, our hero, is only 15, how he talks and how he acts is more like someone who is 17 or 18, in my opinion. I really enjoyed his character and how he progressed through the story. His dragon, Saphira, was also an extremely enjoyable character, with a good sense of humor. Overall, the characters are one of the stronger points of this story, along with the dialogue.

The first half the book was a bit slow and the descriptions and explanations were too long. It felt like the author thought that his audience had never read a fantasy/adventure story before and so everything needed an explanation, extra description, and a gluttony of fantasy description. It made me frustrated and a bit bored. And then the second half of the book happens and suddenly-BAM-tons of action, a fast paced story line, more danger, and more interesting world building. I had a hard time putting the book down. The ending had a lot of action, but it also felt a bit overdone like the beginning.

Still overall I really enjoyed this book. It definitely had a Tolkien feel to it. Also, I've only read one Percy Jackson story, but it reminded me a little of that. I plan on picking up the second book and reading it soon-but I will need a little break in between. I recommend this to anyone who likes YA/Children's fantasy and adventure.

*Im taking this book for its own merits, not what I know of the entire series*

I want to start with my past experiences with this book. I read it for the first time in 2006, right before the movie came out (ugh). The book, and series, has long been one of my favorites. It is near and dear to me. I shipped Eragon and Arya so hard it consumes my life. It was Tolkien level to me. I did a BOOK REPORT on it. I have read it at least 3 more times since then.

This is the first re-read in a while (at least 4 years), and adulthood has shed new light on it. This time I found Eragons character juvenile and whiny, with no concept of his abilities. The only thing that saved him was Saphira, who is hilarious, wise, and noble. I also found it hard to relate to Brom, who I previously adored, he had too many secrets that he hid for no reason other than mystery. I also think it was wrong of him to ask Saphira to keep things from Eragon. Arya and Murtagh are still enjoyable though. I fell out of love with Eragon/Arya through this. He is too obsessed, pushy, and toxic. A 15 yr old fawning over an older woman.

I found flaws in the writing as well. Some lines felt incredibly cheesy and poorly written. Travel times did not seem to line up with distance covered. Many things felt like they were kept secret for shock factor alone. Having the last chapter be the only true battle scene felt a little anticlimactic. The whole book really felt like just an introduction, not a complete story in and of itself. So thank you adulthood for taking the magic out of it for me.

But guess what? I still LOVE this book. The world building, by a 15yr old, was fantastic; multiple languages, a strategic magic system, 5 different species, and major foreshadowing all fantastically written. Although the writing is not Tolkien level, the world is. The sheer amount of fan theories that can be conjectured from the first book is thrilling. The story line is unique (despite people calling it cookie cutter) and adventurous, even when revisiting.

This book will always be a comforting, nostalgic read for me.",rating dropped star im taking book merits know entire series want start past experiences book read first time right movie came ugh book series long one favorites near dear shipped eragon arya hard consumes life tolkien level book report read least times since first least years adulthood shed new light time found eragons character juvenile whiny concept abilities thing saved saphira hilarious wise noble also found hard relate brom previously adored many secrets hid reason mystery also think wrong ask saphira keep things eragon arya murtagh still enjoyable though fell love obsessed pushy toxic yr old fawning older woman found flaws writing well lines felt incredibly cheesy poorly written travel times seem line distance covered many things felt like kept secret shock factor alone last chapter true battle scene felt little anticlimactic whole book really felt like introduction complete story thank adulthood taking magic guess still love book world building old fantastic multiple languages strategic magic system different species major foreshadowing fantastically written although writing tolkien level world sheer amount fan theories conjectured first book thrilling story line unique despite people calling cookie cutter adventurous even revisiting book always comforting nostalgic read,True,Positive,Positive

So, having gotten back into reading again and finally getting my hands on my bookshelf, which has been sadly boxed up in a garage whilst I’ve been away at university, I decided to re-read some of my old books and see how much I enjoyed them as an adult.

When I was younger, I remember enjoying Eragon, but struggling with the second book, Eldest, and being unable to finish it. On the re-read of Eragon, has my opinion changed very much? Not particularly - it’s a decent book, easy to read, full of simple to absorb, predictable fantasy tropes. What struck me as an adult was how young Paolini sounds, which makes perfect sense, as he wrote this as a fifteen year old. And it’s very, very clear that this is the case, particularly as it sounds like he had a thesaurus glued to his hand as he was writing. Do I think this is the work of a prodigy? No. Do I think this is the result of a lucky teenager who’s family had ties to the publishing industry? Yes. I think the book would have been so much more polished and fully realised had it not been published at such a young age, and had gone through a series of revisions over a course of years.

However, this is a children’s novel, so any comparisons, or even accusations of plagiarism, feel disingenuous. It’s meant to be easy to read, like fantasy-lite - it wasn’t meant to be the next Tolkien. It’s written by a child, meant for children. It was never going to be a fully realised, original work. Do I think that Paolini thought it was? Perhaps, which was all the more reason for it to be delayed and revised as he got older. And maybe his parents or his publishers should have taken him down a peg or two, if reports of his arrogance are anything to go by.

On a sort of, fairly relevant point - I decided to pick up Eragon partly because there was a recent push on social media to get a tv series going, and I thought this would be a perfect time to evaluate the criticism I remember being lobbed at the film - that it was far, far inferior to the book. I remember vaguely agreeing with this statement, but over time I came to adore the film and I think it had phased out a lot of my memory of the original novel. It’s funny, because I think the film stands on its own two feet - it may be a cookie cutter, Hollywood fantasy film, but it dealt with Brom’s death in a far more emotional way than the book did, which just sort of dropped it on you after it looked like he was about to recover. (Plus, can we talk about the casting for the film!? It was bloody amazing! Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malcovich, Djimon Hounsou?? Umm, yes please!) I think the book suffers from many of the criticism the film had - it’s sloppy, predictable and pretty superficial. I’ll probably read the sequel, just to see if I can manage to get through it, but it’s not high on my TBR list, and I’ll probably dust it off when I’ve got nothing left to read - so keep tuned for that.",gotten back reading finally getting hands bookshelf sadly boxed garage whilst away university decided old books see much enjoyed adult younger remember enjoying eragon struggling second book eldest unable finish eragon opinion changed much particularly decent book easy read full simple absorb predictable fantasy tropes struck adult young paolini sounds makes perfect sense wrote fifteen year old clear case particularly sounds like thesaurus glued hand writing think work prodigy think result lucky teenager family ties publishing industry yes think book would much polished fully realised published young age gone series revisions course years however children novel comparisons even accusations plagiarism feel disingenuous meant easy read like meant next tolkien written child meant children never going fully realised original work think paolini thought perhaps reason delayed revised got older maybe parents publishers taken peg two reports arrogance anything go sort fairly relevant point decided pick eragon partly recent push social media get tv series going thought would perfect time evaluate criticism remember lobbed film far far inferior book remember vaguely agreeing statement time came adore film think phased lot memory original novel funny think film stands two feet may cookie cutter hollywood fantasy film dealt brom death far emotional way book sort dropped looked like recover plus talk casting film bloody amazing jeremy irons robert carlyle john malcovich djimon hounsou umm yes please think book suffers many criticism film sloppy predictable pretty superficial probably read sequel see manage get high tbr list probably dust got nothing left read keep tuned,True,Positive,Positive
https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.5,"Audiobook review: Gerard Doyle did a good job. For some reason, I especially loved his interpretation of Saphira's mental voice - deep and gravelly.

I first read this book in middle school and loved it (would've given it five stars back then). I liked each succeeding book a little less. But I reread the first book several times as a teenager.

Now... I would probably give it a solid three stars. So I averaged the score out.

First, I would describe the writing style as ""billowy."" But I don't think Paolini described more than he needed to, so I think the book flowed easily enough.

One of the best parts of the book is probably Eragon and Saphira's relationship (though not necessarily the characters themselves). Eragon is an arrogant do-it-all. Saphira is an arrogant know-it-all. They're also a sheltered babies. And since they're in extremely powerful/influential roles, people keep enabling their pride to get on their good sides. So it's kind of amusing that they keep each other in check better than the people around them do.

I also appreciated the plot - simple, but well-planned. I don't think anything got more page time than was necessary.

I still like Murtagh.

The way magic works in this series has always bothered me. Either it wasn't explained well enough, or it's just plain illogical. (I mean, it's magic, but it's not even believable within its own world.)

I was also surprised to find that I didn't really like Angela as much, rereading the book now as an adult. She used to be one of my favorite characters. She used to come off as quirky but now she just seems kind of... arrogant. (There are A LOT of characters in this book that are kind of full of themselves.)

I remember when I would enter his room as a kid, the trilogy was there on his red bookshelf, tattered and sitting beside a glossary of dragons. Fantasy has always been beloved in our household, especially between my brother and I’s imaginations. He used to sketch different wings and write symbols for a new alphabet while I would hold one of my many stuffed unicorns and try to decipher a message. 
 Recently, the name “Eragon” resurfaced after many years of dormancy when at a family meal my brother compared it favorably to “Lord of the Rings” and caused quite the controversy. Another trilogy for which there are certainly parallels, LotR is my father’s most legendary reading experience. He, being someone who doesn’t voraciously read, often remarks about finishing the classic trilogy in a few days when asked about his favorite books. 
 I guess all that is to say, I have no comment, no criticism, no desire or need to line a teen boy’s imagination up beside a potential inspiration. All I had while listening to this audiobook was joy—joy at the lovable characters, the wonderful voices of the narration, the journey as it wound and twisted simply, the sincerity and world, and the old childhood wish I always had to ride a dragon. 
 Joy, most of all, at feeling so connected to my dearest Morgan who happily joined in conversation with me about each new moment I experienced, ready to muse in the way the Hughes family loves to about stories that are special to us.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,3.0,"Me? Reading another whole book already? I am impressed with myself; gonna try to keep this energy up for the rest of the year.

As for the book itself, I have long felt that this book is deeply connected to my existence. Now, I don't really mean that to the same existential extent to which I have meant it in other reviews. Really, what I mean is that my older siblings first read this book when I was much younger, and being a home-schooled family, they would often get to pick audiobooks to play in the car. So I remember hearing bits and pieces throughout my childhood. I also distinctly recall us all being very excited when the movie came out and all watching it together with friends. I understood that the movie was not the best representation of the book, but it was cool and had dragons, so I was quickly enthralled in it.

The first time (I think) that I read Eragon in its entirety was 8th grade. (I am sure I had tried before, without success). I loved it then, although it was a daunting process for me at the time. When I started reading it this time around, I had thought that was the last time I read it. About three quarters of the way through, I realized that I had totally reread the whole thing at some point in high school. Strangely enough, as much as this book has thoroughly engaged me why I am reading, I never feel fully able to recall its contents afterwards. (Of course, this is probably true of most books I've read.) Every time I intend to FINALLY read the sequel, after quite literally a lifetime of waiting, I feel like I must go back and reread to make sure I know what happened beforehand. I'm gonna actually keep going this time, though. Just watch me.

I probably ought to write some of my actual thoughts about the book itself upon reading it this time around. To say the least, it is good. I enjoyed it a great deal. While some of the description is long and a bit arduous at times, I also can see how this develops the world and is part of the genre. One strength I thought a lot about that I had never noticed before was, well. How annoying Eragon is for the first half of the book. Annoying in the sense that he is a fifteen tear old boy who thinks he knows a lot about things and tries to prove himself right but is often wrong and stubborn and frustrating. This bothered me for a minute, but then I realized that it's honestly quite realistic and very impressive execution from the author. Further, as the book develops, we get to see Eragon grow out of his immaturity (too often in response to tragedy), and this also speaks to the strength of the author. No one can read this book and say its protagonist is lacking in character development.

Speaking of characters, it should surprise absolutely No One that Murtagh and Angela are some of my all time favs. An edgy fighter boy with a hidden backstory? And a cryptic and slightly silly witch who is friends with a cat and is first seen holding a frog? Perfect. All that I need in a novel, really.

I will say, by way of critique, it quite bothered me this time around reading Eragon's attitude toward an unconscious woman for over half the book. I understand that he is desperately trying to save her. That makes sense. And he should. BUT. The way he thinks about her and her body is a bit disconcerting to say the least. I don't think this fully takes away from the book's merits, but the book would not have been hurt at all is some of this description was left out. Like, I get he has a crush on Arya. And that's fine.. but.. I think there was a better way to convey it.

All that said, as I finished the book today, I realized how impactful the final two scenes are. There is a reason I keep returning to this book, and a portion of of it is knowing the entire time what an epic climax the whole book is building toward. I feel in awe every time I read it.

One final note, I read this book listening to the audiobook as I followed along in the text. I really appreciate the reader for most things. However.. his voice for Sapphira reminds me a bit too much of Jim Henson's edgy era. So much so that shortly after starting this book, I felt compelled to go rewatch Labyrinth. This isn't the worst thing, but I personally would have preferred a softer tone.

And, as time has passed, I've learned that some of the novels I loved so much were really not that good.

This is one of them.

Eragon borrows so heavily from Star Wars and LotR that I'm surprised no one attempted to sue him. When I was a teenager, LotR wasn't my type of novel--the flowery prose threw me. Now that I'm older, I can see LotR as a flawed masterpiece. Not so with Eragon.

I think it's telling that Paolini never wrote anything after this series. If he'd had any talent, he'd have been able to write something else. It's disappointing to me, especially after coming down from the high that The Stormlight Archive gave me. Brandon Sanderson is amazing, even with his repetition. Paolini is not.

That being said, it is flawed. The book probably deserves closer to 3 stars, but I adore the story so I’m giving it 3.5. All protagonists are likable and as far as Eragon or Brom are concerned, as soon as you think “oh, great, they’re a stereotype” you’re quickly reminded that they are realistically fallible and, while they fit into an archetype, they’re unmistakably their own character. The plot is quick and at times a little choppy, and I think the ending is sudden and could have been fleshed out more. Really, a lot happens in this book, and while it feels long, I wish certain areas (like training with Brom) were expanded a bit to show more progress and even world building.

Inspiration is obviously taken from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, but unlike harsh critics, I think it’s a nod to favorite works and a nice take on existing tropes, not theft or laziness. I think this is my third time reading the series (it’s been a few years tho) and while I remember enough not to be surprised yet still be excited for what’s to come, the little details still get me— I had to rework my mental image of Brom, Arya, and Saphira! And I don’t remember Brom being so… hard. But those little details keep the story—outside of the driving plot— interesting.

It’s hard to separate this individual book from the entire series, but I think it’s worth a good 3.5 stars and although it’s not perfect, I certainly never wanted to put it down.

I'm being politely inquisitive here, because I thought this book was absolutely fantastic. Un-put-down-able.
Sure enough, it has its use of tropes, but I believe in execution as well as plot and in my opinion, this book was very well-written indeed.
It has a LOTR vibe, but what of it? Inspiration is not wrong. Plagiarism is. Orcs and Urgals, that's as close as it gets. Elves, yes, but is Eragon the only one who took after Tolkien's elves? I don't see hobbits and rings in the book either, and by the way, dragons are horrible stuff in middle earth.
Am I being too technical? Yes, I am, but the way I see it, a lot of the reviewers I see here are indulging in the opposite, which is over-simplifying this story. Books cannot be judged this way. For instance, 95% of fantasy stories can be covered with ""go on a quest"", and 99% of romance novels are simply ""two people attracted to each other go through some stuff to get together"". Does that necessarily mean they're not good? No.
I don't mean that this is the most original book on the planet, I just think that this book isn't as undeserving as a lot of people deem it.

Oh yes. And Murtag, anyone? He was awesome! He
Spoiler
banged an Urgal on the head!! That should count for something.

Maybe I'm in the minority, but I love this book. Also, I can promise that some LOTR fanatics can still enjoy this and not find it sacrilegious. I have a friend (!) who is one of those die-hard LOTR fans who has a zero-tolerance policy towards any LOTR negativity (!!) and she absolutely lurved this.
I can understand it if you dislike Eragon, but I think it still has some redeeming qualities we can't overlook. At least the author knows his vocab and language, and if you insist, at least he knows how to use a thesaurus.

It's been an easy fifteen years since I last read this book. (The movie came out in 2006. Just checked on that. So yeah. Probably longer than fifteen years.)
And it's funny. I remember parts of the video game better than I remembered the movie, and I remembered the book better than that.
So. Eragon. Orphaned farm boy. Living that normal life. A little disgruntled with things but really, what teenager isn't? Only to have something strange crash land and drag him into a more brilliant and dangerous world where he is accompanied by the old, weird storyteller that is more than what he seems to be. Oh, and there's a girl who needs saving and a wise-cracking, skilled fighter who has no desire to join the rebels in their fight against the king. 
Gee, I think I just described A New Hope.
Eragon is basically Star Wars but with dragons. This first book at least though perhaps the next three also vibe. I don't remember them all that well except for bits and pieces of the plot twists because yowza.
Anyway. First book. Dragon. Saphira. She is stunning and lovely and oh so alien and wise. It's nice to have her have dragon sensibilities and tendencies and thoughts rather than human ones. Because she is a dragon.
Eragon. My dude. He's basically Luke Skywalker. Except a whole lot less whiny and his grieving makes far more sense than Luke's. He gets more training and more time before he has to go save the rebels from the Emperor. I mean, King. 
Can we just compare Galbatorix and Palpatine for a minute here? I'm not going to because spoilers.
Murtaugh. My dude. My man. My love. Reading this threw me straight back into my love for him. I'd forgotten how much. I mean, when the Murtagh book was announced (which is 100% why I'm rereading now so I can be prepared), I immediately was filled with glee and delight because I remembered that I loved him but I did not remember why or how. Reading this just reiterates how much I adore him. As much as I love Eragon, Murtagh is a love of my life. Does this explain why? No. But I will say, there is a part where he is locked up. And when Eragon gets a chance to talk to him, my dude is like ""You know, I thought I'd hate this. But people leave me alone and I kind of like this."" And I feel that in my bones.  Also he registers in my head as ""super hot"" even though I couldn't describe him to you nor could I tell you why he is super hot. He just is. 
The only one who I can picture clearly is Brom and he's Jeremy Irons. Jeremy Irons is perfect in every role I’ve seen him play and that isn't changing now. Brom is Jeremy Irons and I love him too.
Also, if you come here having seen the movie and not read the books, that ending battle has been seriously changed. I questioned my own memory there for a hot minute. Basically, they pulled a Deathly Hallows Part 2. More exciting? Maybe. More impactful and impressive? Hardly. 

But like. Dragons. And it's well-written in plot and tension and characters. If you like dragons at all, read the book. Because there's a Disney+ series coming out with the author co-writing and also the Murtagh book coming out in November, which I'm counting as a birthday present to me.

The book did not hold my attention starting around the half-way mark, but picked up again in the last few chapters.

Well-written, but some descriptive paragraphs were skip-able, mostly involving the mental dialogue between Eragon and Saphrina. I feel that could have been presented differently, or edited better.

Two big irritations:
1. this is clearly Tolkein fan-fiction, which makes me think of the bared to you -> 50 shades -> twilight thing, and I am never happy when I think about Twilight. Although, Twilight was an original idea, so I should give Meyer more credit than I do. Also, I believe we should encourage fanfiction, but should it be promoted in mass market form? I just... don't really know how to feel about it.
2. It is one thing to have unfinished storylines to lead into the series, but entirely another to not finish any storyline at all.

It certainly doesn't help that high fantasy's not my thing, nor that I only picked it up because the library's having a release party for the fourth (and supposedly final) installment, Inheritance, but Eragon failed pretty spectacularly for me. I made it to about page 300, and then decided that Wikipedia can tell me pretty much everything I need to know plot-wise.

I listened to nearly the first half of the book on audio, and while Gerard Doyle is a decent narrator all things considered, I really couldn't get over his choice of voice for the (female) dragon Saphira. Basically, she sounded like Yoda on a steady diet of cigarettes and whiskey, and I couldn't take her seriously anymore - her voice made me giggle too much.

But honestly, the straw that really broke the camel's back is that Eragon is a whiny, whiny little bitch. He complains and complains and complains some more, and I kept yelling at my stereo as if I could somehow make him stop. Spoiler alert: HE DOESN'T STOP.

Brom is the only interesting character, and his story would be much more exciting than the hot mess that is the the actual plot. What Brom tells us about joining up with the Varden and trying to take on the Empire would actually be kind of interesting. Eragon whining about his training and begging Brom for more information all the time? Not so much. The battle going on between the Empire and the Varden requires so much explanation that it brings the plot to a screeching halt anytime Brom DOES choose to be forthcoming, and in the end, I was hoping that the Ra'zac or the Urgals or Galbatorix or whatever would just put an end to Eragon already. But he's the chosen one or something, so naturally he's a quick study (despite whining every time he has to put actual effort into training) and the greatest swordsman ever and probably the most specialest, awesomest dragon rider to ever exist, and I just had to stop.

Paolini's writing is not revolutionary, the book is completely devoid of humor, and the plot is primarily an amalgamation of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Even though there be dragons here, this isn't a new story and it doesn't have anything new to add to the fantasy canon.

Obviously Eragon has quite a following now, but it's not timeless by any means.

A great read, I especially liked the world building. From the beginning, the world building was great with casual and good introductions and explanations. The map was awesome, of course. The concepts were really good with the dwarves, elves, Riders and a classic normal turned evil character.

Now, my favorite thing was definitely the dragons. If I were to rate the book based on how much I loved Saphira, I would give it 5 stars and more. I like good characters in a story and I was thoroughly happy with this book and how it handled development.

I didn't think it was slow because new things were being introduced so the pace didn't feel off considering how much establishment was there. I liked how things weren't rushed.

Some issues I saw were the scene transitions and the lack of time given to the combat training and development of Eragon. With any scenes that had a fight, they seemed to end soon and a transition would happen with Eragon waking up after fainting which soon felt overused and predictive.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,3.0,"It’s hard to escape the reputation of the Inheritance Cycle. Even those who have not read Eragon but grew up during the time when it was published know the story about how Christopher Paolini finished this book at a very young age and with the help of his family managed to get this story about a boy and his blue dragon in front of a lot of people. However, I personally feel like the focus on his age only does so much for the conversation. So in this review, I will not give him a pass, praise, or be extra harsh just because of the circumstances of how this book was published. When something is good, it’s good. When I found something to be executed very poorly, I’ll be honest about it.

With that out of the way, I have to say that I found myself enjoying this book a lot more than I thought I would. It’s a common story of mine, but I gave up reading Eragon after getting a good portion of the way through, mostly because I just had so much to read. Now through the power of audiobooks, I managed to finish the entire thing. I am currently on the third book as I write this, but I think I can compartmentalize my feelings of the first two of the series very easily.

Alright, so what does Eragon get right? Oddly enough, I think what Paolini excels at the most is with his characters and their relationships. These are very familiar tropes to be sure, but there is also a ton of care and craft to their personalities and motivations. Eragon’s interactions with Brom, Murtagh, and Saphira stick out the most to in this regard. The story meanders quite a bit, but this allows the audience to really get to know these characters and feel like they can sit down and have a conversation with them.

With this being called a rip off of many other properties, I expected certain plot points to play out a certain way, only to be pleasantly surprised when I found that to not be the case. I won’t go into too much detail, lest I bring up spoilers, but let me just say that I love that Eragon’s actions have consequences. Yes, he can be a bit whiny at points, but the story does not give him a pass at this. When Eragon makes a mistake, there are dire costs and he actually learns from them. Sometimes authors can forget to make these moments very impactful and I’m happy to see it done so well here.

Other stuff you’ve heard is true as well. The world is interesting but familiar. The magic system is as well but you have a firm grasp on the rules and it’s fun to see all the different ways it can be used. This allows the action scenes to be as stellar as they are and the final battle especially can be tense at times.

However, this book is also far from perfect and not exactly in the way that you’d think. Originality is honestly the last thing I care about when it comes critiquing these stories. Even the exposition I didn’t mind so much because of how well it was written and the position of the main character being new to all this.

No, my issue was with the structure.

Simply put, Eragon passes out way too much in this book. So many scenes and chapters won’t be allowed to end unless we see him fall asleep or get knocked out somehow. I don’t think I’d mind so much if it wasn’t for how often this is used to advance the story with major plot points happening off screen. It got so repetitive that I just started to expect it whenever a battle broke out, only to be proven right time and time again when our hero blacked out. If any problem could have been fixed in this story, I honestly feel like it should have been this one. It really muddles the tension when this happens and it was the main thing that dragged down the book for me.

Everything else was done fine, but I think that’s the key here. While it does well in several departments, that’s kind of all it does. This isn’t a very challenging fantasy. It is very comfortable and familiar, while also being a fun short adventure. It does get better from here, but for all these reasons and more, I’m going to give Eragon, book one of the Inheritance Cycle, a 6 out of 10. It is above average but also lays the groundwork for what can be an awesome series, if the second book is anything to go by.

The first half was horrible and painful to read, I barely endured wanting to give up and throw it in the fire, but once the half mark was breached the story improved dramatically and the writing style also improved.

The first half had very poor characterisation with every character seemingly having the exact same personality. I found a lack of depth for the heroes and villains rather frustrating throughout the story, though it did still produce some likeable characters including Murtagh.

I have given concessions for this story as it was written by someone very young at the time. Looking back at my own world I know it was rather primitive and just shallow copies of other peoples worlds, so I understand. But I kind of wish the author waited 5 years instead. Which may have created greater complexity and improved style. For what it is, it is good.

A lot of negative reviews exist for this novel. Many disregard Paolini’s writing ability because the book’s plot too closely follows the world of Tolkien or the plot of Star Wars, but what they aren’t giving him credit for is the interesting and vivid specifics he presented as a TEENAGER.

A teenager may have read Tolkein or binged Star Wars then sat down and thought, “I can do that” and he did. He created a new world of dragons, elves, and more on their own journey of revenge, prophecies, and more not only in one book but in an epic three story trilogy.

Eragon is a story of destiny, embracing a quest- and when a reader can stop and remind themselves it was all written by a 16yr old boy inspired, then they can see the affection and love within the style. I enjoyed it not as the ‘next Lord of the Rings’ and not as a ‘fantasy Star Wars’ but as its own ‘from the mind of a creative teenager’

For about the first two thirds of this, I felt like it was harmless fun. There wasn't very much original here, but the hero was likeable, if a bit too capable at everything he tried. The dragon was a fun character. The setting, while unoriginal, was richly detailed. The action scenes were creative and exciting, and the pacing was good.

Then the author decided that it was a good idea to keep the most important non-dragon female character in the story unconscious for like ten chapters. And once she finally awakened, the tired heroic fantasy clichés were suddenly accompanied by tired sexist clichés. There is actually a moment where the hero, on the eve of a huge battle, and after just having it proved to him that the female warrior is a better fighter than he is, still manages to express his wish that she had been evacuated with the women and children rather than, you know, helping with the battle.

This book was published in 2002. The other book I'm reading right now is a fantasy novel published in 1900, which handles its female characters better then Eragon does.

Having said all of that, the ending does deliver a very good final battle, and sets up the next book in the series.

I enjoyed the trio despite the clear similarities to another more famous trilogy, Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. Paolini uses Elves, Men, Dwarves, and an evil race, the Urgals (instead of Orcs), like Tolkien did. I think Tolkien did it better, but Paolini's books are not bad. I am looking forward to reading the final (surprise) book in the series, I'm especially looking forward to the battle with the main bad guy, Galbatorix.

It's been a bit of a bumpy ride, to say the least. Not that I didn't enjoy Eragon, I enjoyed it immensely. For starters, I'd forgotten just how vivid and beautiful Paolini's writing really is...some of his descriptions of the scenery (especially) are truly mind-blowing, IMO. And with that came a deeper respect and appreciation for his unique vision.
His characters are fairly well developed, the story is engaging (though not AS engaging as the first time around,) and there are plenty of twists and turns, along with a few stunning revelations. Even as a re-read, said revelations came as a pleasant surprise.. In fact, much of the novel shocked and delighted me in unexpected ways, as I'd forgotten a majority of it. Like almost all of my re-reads, this one was also like reading it for the first time.
Now as brilliant as his writing tends to be, I was slightly turned off by its overall simplicity, but that's completely subjective. I prefer books that challenge me in some way or other, and his writing simply doesn't do that.
Considering its simplicity, I feel I should have finished it much sooner, and I think some of that stems from just that: it's almost TOO simple.

Despite its flaws (perhaps that's too strong of a word,) the novel's conclusion left me wanting more, and I cannot wait to find out how everything unfolds.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,4.0,"Judging from most of the reviews of this book that I have seen, it seems to be a love-it-or-hate it proposition. I didn't hate this book, no - far from it. I liked this book. Is it perfect? No. Is it a ""new wave of fantasy""? No, not really. It's not any more substantial than any of the Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance novels we read in our younger years.

But, that being said - it IS a fun read, and it IS a decent adventure - which first and foremost makes it succeed as a fantasy novel. It doesn't need to be pretentious to be enjoyable, and taken on its merits, Eragon is an enjoyable read, despite it's flaws.

The good:

-Adventure! This book was written with lots of excitement. There is little brooding, methodical plot and world-building machinations in this book, and it emerges the better for it. Want to introduce us to a part of the setting? Just thrust us there during the journey and explain along the way.

-Action! For those of you that enjoy high fantasy with great feats of magic and heroism, this book has them. And those who enjoy large scale fantasy battles get a bone thrown their way towards the end, too.

-Dragons! For those of you with a dragon fetish (don't act that way, you know who you are), this book has a dragon as one of the main characters. It adds an interesting dynamic to the whole thing. Saphira ends up being one of the better characters in the story, just because she is different (in a good way).

The bad:

-Agonizingly derivative. Have you ever read a fantasy novel in your life, or seen Star Wars? Good. Then you know about 60-70% of the plot and character development in Eragon already. Elves are elves, dwarves are dwarves, Urgals are pretty much orcs, the magic system is nothing new if you've read Earthsea before, etc.

-Cardboard characters. Eragon himself is precariously close to a Mary Sue - able to go almost anywhere and do almost anything better than the other characters, few flaws if any, and has almost no individual character development past author/reader insertion, i.e. ""Wow, I can do this thing! That's great! Or, Wow look at that mountain! I've never been here before!"" . In fact, most of the characters are defined by what their abilities are rather than who they are as people. Do we really know who Eragon or any of the other characters really are as people by the end of the book? The most developed character, I think, is Murtagh - mostly because we know he has motivations, opinions, and backstory that wasn't a result of being railroaded by the plot.

The ugly:

-Limited chances taken with the story. One can tell that this book was written by a teenager. Simplicity in plot, vocabulary, and setting, lacking the nuances that make other books unique - Eragon is a generic fantasy tale in a generic fantasy world.

For as complex a character as Eragon is I was left wanting something more. More thought, more emotion explained, more nurturing to who he is as opposed to acceptance. I know he was trained over a period of time to user Magic, but he just happens to know the very key important words to get things done. It's like his crash course in life has set him straight for the future. He could also read within a week. And now he just knows it all.

I usually like my characters having one role, but Eragon is his whole adventuring party wrapped into one character, which made it hard for me to like any other character other than Brom, because Brom was at one point better than Eragon. This is probably my RPG self talking.

Like any other popular series, I play Sherlock Holmes with it. Mind you, it's not that great, but I try my best. So here's the change of my rating on the journey of reading this book:

When I heard it from my younger sister, Shanice. She is crazy
over this series.: 4 stars.
When I start reading it: 3 stars.
As time progresses: 2 stars.
When I finish reading the book: (obviously) 2.5 stars.

The first dragon book I read about is [b:Seraphina|19549841|Seraphina (Seraphina, #1)|Rachel Hartman|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1387577872s/19549841.jpg|17375239]. And coupled the experience with what my sister told me, I was mentally prepared and Eragon definitely live up to the expectation of being lengthy but descriptive. I applaud Paolini for his excellent command of English and his penchant for minute details, especially for someone who wrote it at 15 years old. I was also (sort of) writing a novel at that age and it was and still is absolute rubbish.

However, those are unfortunately all my compliments for this book.
And as you can see, it is short indeed.

Paolini's world-building bears an uncanny resemblance to Lord of the Rings (the movies, that is. I haven't had the courage to pick up the books). It is basically a compilation of cliches and fantasy of a fifteen-year-old boy, filled with dragons (mock squeel) and elegant, drop-dead gorgeous future-girlfriend (sarcastic snort). Yes, there is one special female in the entire book. One. Besides Angela the witch, whom we can see our dear hero just think of as weird with his limited IQ. Talk about chauvinistic writing. The said witch told him of his future romance, which is epic of course, with a noble race. Coupled that with the stupid and horny way Eragon acts around Arya, it is basically like a shining neon light. And no, if you're asking, I do not particularly care about the future couple. In fact, I find myself reading the book with a very cold and indifferent detatchment, which proves of the author's failure better than anything I could say if you ask me.

The narration of the book is on a serious note, a more mature note, with lengthy phrases, lots of commas and as aforementioned, descriptive. As any other readers, my frame of mind cannot help but be in tune with that tenor, if you know what I mean. Hence, it is quite confusing for me when I read Eragon’s foolish acts with that same writing. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m more used to the narration reflecting the maturity of the first character. Yes, I noticed that it is from a third person point-of-view, but it is no less confusing. Sometimes I even laughingly think that this is a good example of juxtaposition in words. I don’t know whether this is intentional or not, but if it is, I can’t really see the point in it.
But if you think about it, I doubt there's a way of narration that can match Eragon's recklessness which makes him a boderline fool.

Speaking of, my biggest problem with this book: Eragon the character. As I have said, due to the mature writing, I inadvertently picture Eragon as a mature boy despite his young age. Hence, his reckless acts are more of a surprise for me than it normally would have. At first, I reason with myself that the author did this on purpose because he wants to show Eragon’s growth in the next few books. I mean, hell, with the thickness of each of them that is certainly achievable.

So, with that reasoning, I continue reading. Yes, I still cringe and roll my eyes when Eragon’s actions cause harm to people. Man, does he remind me of Frodo! At times, it seems like his only purpose in the book is being irritating. So, as you can understand, I breathe a sigh (maybe more) of relief when it seems Eragon has run out of foolish acts. But then, he bloody did it again!

And that is what makes him a big strike to the book. It is either due to poor execution on Paolini’s part or intentional. If it is intentional, then this is a fact: Eragon has mood-swings worse than females (even during that time of the month). I mean, he can literally go from being friendly to Brom to snapping at him and saying things like “I’m not sure I want you to follow me on this journey” in one page!

I don’t know whether Eragon is childish or bipolar but he sure is an arse. The way he treats Saphira is appalling. There is none of the supposed bond between boy and dragon that I have been hoping to see. And the way he treats Murtagh is also equally scandalous. He could’ve so easily get himself, Murtagh and Arya killed in that valley. And the time when he learnt of Murtagh’s heritage? That just shows how prejudice of a person he is. I mean, he basically forces Murtagh to tell him, the least he could have done is show some decency of being a friend. Murtagh saved his life after all.

The last thing I want to point out is also the of-course-ness in this book. I supposed it is inevitable, just like Harry Potter is definitely the hero in Harry Potter the book, but still… The time when Brom and Eragon meet a dead end, Brom didn’t find anything with his keen eyes but of course Eragon found the key to continue their journey when bumbling around. When Eragon wants to save Arya so badly, of course he was captured and put in the same jail as her and of course he happened to be awake the one time they brought Arya out of her cell. When Eragon and Murtagh is near death, of course the Varden pick that time to rescue them. Can’t let our beloved hero get killed after all. And of course Eragon is the one that killed the Shade. I mean, he is pampered and spoiled and childish and stupid with bad instincts but hey, he's our hero. Yay.

I’m assured by my sister that this ass-ness of Eragon will cease in the third book. In fact, she says she will personally kill me if I still speak of Eragon this way in the third book onwards. But I doubt the childish writing will cease with the improvement of Eragon's character. So we’ll see…

The author spent a lot of time saying things that did not need to be said. The descriptions of traveling could have been shorter and the people could have been more detailed. The biggest thing that bothered me about this book was that there was so much teaser foreshadowing that may have not been foreshadowing at all. Insignificant things would bother Eragon and the reader would be informed of such but the book ended without those feelings being resolved. If the author plans to resolve these ideas in the next books he is going to have to back pedal into a lot of details from the first book to explain himself.

Eragon progressed from farm boy to Master Dragon Rider pretty quickly and that kind of irked me. I suppose this could be attributed to the fact that Riders have greater abilities but I wasn't completely sold.

To start off I just wanted to say that I’m a sucker for fantasy, so this book, being an epic novel and all, was like heaven for me. I was just indulging in this book day to night, and it was, in my eyes, Fantastic. I loved this book soooo much. It was all very planned out and well written, with a right amount of those big words, which people like me and jenny (Wondrous Reads) etc. look out for. J

The plot and story was epic. Very cool, and I loved it. Everything would slot into place leaving you on a cliff-hanger after the end of a chapter, and then you’d read the next chapter and find the missing piece to the puzzle only to find that you still need another piece. At the end you find that you are nowhere near completing the puzzle, and that there is a ton of pieces to fit together which we will all find out about in Eldest, Brisingr, Shur’tugal and any more Inheritance novels to come.


Adult version cover
I found it amazing how Paolini came up with all the names of the places and ancient words etc, as from what I’ve heard he invented them all himself which must have been one big job. He probably wrote a whole translation dictionary!!! Well actually he did use a lot of old German and Russian but a lot he invented himself. I was out-standed by the way one man could have such and imagination and if you ask me, it’s probably not Meyer vs. Rowling anymore but paolini vs. Rowling. I was also amazed the he could create a whole new world of his own, and name all the places, and that fact that he actually created a map, well... WOW!!!! I guess.

Onto the characters... Arya and Eragon, no doubt my favourite characters, also the perfect couple although one thing I couldn’t get my head round was Elf and Human. Really??? It just didn’t seem to work but from the way paolini described her she is one stunna! Hands of guys, Grrr, Arya’s mine. Murtagh was the interesting character though, Son of Morzan – Good? That really got me and to be honest I still don’t trust him. There’s something about him, just... I don’t know. But he’s character to watch, because he may be minor but later I think he could become a major character and not for a good reason. Brom... I was so sad when Brom died, that was so devastating and the bad part was that it wasn’t even a bid send-off. He just went. Cut in the side – Gone! Poof. Saphira was awesome, I was loving it when she got jealous of Arya though, that was hilarious. It’s not like she and Eragon could ever be together in that way.
Overall I think the characters were well formed and had good foundations to start, bud paolini also didn’t spend 100 pages just on the past lives of all the characters which made me very happy as I hate when authors do that. For instance with harry potter it’s different because his past plays a big part but for some books it’s just not necessary. But just a couple of words ‘Well done Paolini, you have created some of my now favourite characters! J)

I was recommended this book by one of my guy friends who knows how much i enjoy reading fantasy with all that magic and what not. He wanted me to read it so much that I gave into his whim and consumed this book in about a week, which i found astounded with school and marching band taking over most of my life.

I have read many mixed reviews on this book before getting started. I was wary towards reading this because of that but my wariness was extremely wrong because this was a fabulous story. Reading about how Paolini was only 15 when he got his book published had me insanely jealous but also has me determined to reach for that goal even though i'm older than the 15 year mark.

Though I felt that the book was rather slow towards the beginning, many of the battle scenes that take place and the dialogue with Eragon and Saphira was beautiful and fun to read. Even reading about the legend of the Dragon Riders and the past of the characters was tragic but engaging. Those scenes never bored me but had me blowing through page after page, hungry for more.

I'm glad I was recommended this book. I would have eventually read it but my friend happened to push me enough to get me to read it with so many other books in my TBR pile piling up. And now we will be engaging in lengthy discussion and maybe some fangirling (though he is a male).",reviews rondo possible world ya book reviews recommended book one guy friends knows much enjoy reading fantasy magic wanted read much gave whim consumed book week found astounded school marching band taking life read many mixed reviews book getting started wary towards reading wariness extremely wrong fabulous story reading paolini got book published insanely jealous also determined reach goal even though older year mark though felt book rather slow towards beginning many battle scenes take place dialogue eragon saphira beautiful fun read even reading legend dragon riders past characters tragic engaging scenes never bored blowing page page hungry glad recommended book would eventually read friend happened push enough get read many books tbr pile piling engaging lengthy discussion maybe fangirling though male,True,Positive,Positive

The writing in this book was completely and fantastically immersive, and very much like drinking warm hot chocolate. But it lacked a kind of sharp edge--it was dull. Yet, this is perfect if you want to get so entirely lost in something, where you're in a sleepy, hazy, dazy place where you feel like you've been sedated and enveloped by a warm blanket, removed from yourself, and solely, thoroughly inside the story of dragons and riders. I still can't put my finger on what about the writing made it so immersive and comfy and familiar and satisfying, but it glows in that aspect.

Because if he had waited, he might have realized for himself that this reads like a self-insert fanfic in the worst way.

It's not completely incompetent, if examined at surface-level. But none of this book holds up to modest scrutiny. It's clear that the author has read and loved a lot of classic high fantasy stories, but he doesn’t quite seem to understand (at least in this book) why certain elements are presented the way Tolkien and others have presented them. The bad guys are all laughably exaggerated and too obviously eeevviiilllll to be engaging. And other than the fact that the big bad seems to have ordered the deaths of innocent people (which, yes, that’s bad, but bear with me), he doesn’t actually do anything that bad. The people complain about how he makes them pay taxes, and it's like, yep, that’s what kings do. And as for the actually bad stuff, he has no motive whatsoever.

The writing is also pretty lacking. It's competent enough that it moves the story along (and sounds pretty okay when read aloud, especially with an Irish / Scottish / British accent—if you’re going to read this, listen to the audiobook), but there's an abundance of adverbs and weird speaker tags that make no sense and are pretty distracting. Also, the way that most characters talk is unbelievable. They do that thing where they talk all high-brow and serious, and it comes off as silly rather than intimidating or noble.

There are also too many dumb or just nonsensical decisions made in this book for me to take it seriously or stay invested. Most of them involved taking the characters to different locales with no real reason for them to be there, except maybe a weak attempt at world-building? But the big one is Brom's decision to allow Eragon to avenge his uncle's death. Sure, it sets the plot in action, but it raises a lot of questions regarding whether this is a wise decision (spoiler alert: it's not, except it is because Eragon is stupidly over-powered and I hate it). For example, why encourage this child to make such a rash decision? Maybe Brom could have tricked him in order to get Eragon on his side, but that's not the case. Don't you think you might want to train this simple farm boy for several years in these supposedly difficult arts of sword fighting and magic wielding before allowing him to face the most dangerous forces in this fantasy land? Did you maybe want to do that, supposed-to-be-wise old man???

But I forget, Eragon is our special snowflake of the day and therefore learns in a matter of days what it takes most people IN THIS UNIVERSE (because these are established rules of this universe, not just me judging based on our world's rules) literally years if not a lifetime to learn! Because truly, this is not a unique new world using a versatile template created by masters of their craft, but a teenage boy's power fantasy.

I don't think it's harsh to call this what it is. I feel bad for Paolini, because while I don't think this is a blight on his career, as it's still quite popular and he seems to be doing well enough for himself, it does hang a dark cloud over it. And honestly, having read it twice now and not liked it both times, it makes me not want to pick up anything else he's written, let alone the rest of this series. Which is a shame, because I own two of them, and they look quite nice on my bookshelf.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,5.0,"Just as I expected, this book was simply a product of a hopeful young author (with little to no experience honing his craft) with very good connections in the publication business.

It's clear Paolini looks up to the works of geniuses like JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, Phillip Pullman, Brian Jacques and other epic fantasy authors - so much of his book copies these tropes and sets them into motion in his own made-up world.

There's a fair amount of potential here, I'll give him that. But there is severe need for improvement. Oftentimes, I feel like Paolini tries way too hard to reach the likes of his inspirations.

His characters are forgettable, unlikeable, and boring - with maybe the exception of Brom or Murtagh or whoever it is who's kind of badass. Eragon remains my least favourite character. He's boring, whiny, flat, kind of a Gary Stu, and simply uninteresting.

The plot is very lacklustre. Things happen. But why? Why should we, as readers, care? You can take traditional tropes and make them interesting; it's not impossible. Everything here, however, just feels like a sub par rehash of some previous, great novel. If I wanted to read said great novel, I'll literally pluck up my copy of The Fellowship of the Ring and call it a day. I'm not interested in reading a bargain-bin version of my favourite book, thank you very much.

There's nothing new, nothing that motivates me to read the next book(s) in the series.

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,3.0,"EDIT: ok I’ve decided to rate it. My points still stand, as the book isn’t for me, but there are many books like this that I do love so I feel better rating it

This was a hard one to rate, and I don’t think I’m going to. Instead, my review is going to start with my reasons for this:

1) I am not the target audience anymore. I might have loved this book and had way less problems with it as a ten to fourteen year old (which I think is probably the target audience). There are middle grade books I have loved and rated 4.5 or 5 stars, and there are middle grade books that have a lot of nostalgia for me. I am comfortable rating middle grade, usually except... this isn’t really middle grade. Or it wasn’t written with that age category as an established category, yet. Which leads me to my next point.

2) when Eragon was published there was literature and children’s literature. In the last twenty years, YA has truly emerged as a viable category for marketing, and from there, other categories have also emerged: new adult, middle grade, and various levels of children’s. Eragon is a young adult protagonist, and this world is on a young adult level, but the writing and plot beats and character are much more reminiscent of middle grade or children’s. Because Paolini was writing in a time where you threw stories at the market of young people and hoped it stuck to them. Not saying he didn’t have an age range in mind or that people of all ages don’t enjoy this book, just pointing out that the YA I’m used to has a certain reading level, intricacy of plot, and character work that is different from those things in Eragon. It’s hard to rate it now because Eragon was published for a different audience, in a different world for publishing. Paolini was also reading different things than me as a teen, which impacted how he wrote...

3) because he was writing as a teenager. This book is very much someone with a talent for storytelling working out the kinks of the craft. And I don’t really want to nitpick the writing or the plot or the character work of an author’s debut from his teen years.

What I think you need to know going in is that Eragon reads a lot younger than I was expecting. The pacing is a bit off, mainly due to this being a long travel narrative. If you don’t like travel narratives, you won’t love this book. If you don’t like middle grade generally and don’t have nostalgia for this series, I’m not sure it’s for you. However, if you like dragons, travel narratives, and really spending time in a world you may like this book. If you’re a plot person like me, you may feel the plot was underwhelming. If you’re a character person, the characters do fall into various tropes. If you can forgive that and focus on the story, which is fun, then you might have a really good time with this one",edit ok decided rate points still stand book many books like love feel better rating hard one rate think going instead review going start reasons target audience anymore might loved book way less problems ten fourteen year old think probably target audience middle grade books loved rated stars middle grade books lot nostalgia comfortable rating middle grade usually except really middle grade written age category established category yet leads next point eragon published literature children literature last twenty years ya truly emerged viable category marketing categories also emerged new adult middle grade various levels children eragon young adult protagonist world young adult level writing plot beats character much reminiscent middle grade children paolini writing time threw stories market young people hoped stuck saying age range mind people ages enjoy book pointing ya used certain reading level intricacy plot character work different things eragon hard rate eragon published different audience different world publishing paolini also reading different things teen impacted wrote writing teenager book much someone talent storytelling working kinks craft really want nitpick writing plot character work author debut teen years think need know going eragon reads lot younger expecting pacing bit mainly due long travel narrative like travel narratives love book like middle grade generally nostalgia series sure however like dragons travel narratives really spending time world may like book plot person like may feel plot underwhelming character person characters fall various tropes forgive focus story fun might really good time one,True,Positive,Positive

https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/d593cc1a-9322-4a94-8706-30a819885f6f,5.0,"So this is either my fourth or fifth reread? Honestly not sure, but I have some fairly vivid memories of the following books, so I’m not perfectly able to review this book on its own so to speak. Add this to the fact that I feel deeply nostalgic about Eragon as my favorite series from childhood, this is a FAR from unbiased take. With that being said, I fricking loved this book lol. I devoured it basically in one sitting (not a flex bc it’s a children’s book), and was kinda actively crying most of the time hahahaha. 

Look, from the perspective of  “is this the most groundbreaking incredibly written fantasy novel ever conceived”, like… obviously not. But given the fact that it was a very enjoyable, super quick paced read (written by a 15 year old no less), I have very few complaints. My biggest actual complaint is the way fatness = villainy, which is a big bummer. But tbh I was shocked to read this from my current perspective and sniff out some (maybe unintentional idk?) lowkey liberatory politics in there? Like we had some disabled side (some VERY side like one sentence mentions vibes) characters who aren’t evil (**SLIGHT SPOILER** yet lol, bc Murtagh but also he gets redeemed so idk complex **END SPOILERS**) and some side characters of color… obviously single sentence mentions don’t get awards, but it’s still nice to be like “oh cute we’re acknowledging disabled people exist, sweet”. An unfortunate lack of queer character representation which is also a bummer AND I have soooome patience bc there’s not a TON of attention given to romantic relationships in general and gender diversity is just too much to ask for in a mainstream early 2000s fantasy book unfortunately. But this brings me to the thing I loved most:

Eragon and Saphira’s relationship (brb crying for days). I just… I LOVE them??? I LOVE Saphira?? And I LOVE the way they love each other??? It’s not a “perfect” relationship- they snap at each other, they occasionally fail to communicate at all, there are misunderstandings and frustrations… and yet, there’s also this deep respect and unconditional love that is SO beautiful to read about. I feel like friendships so rarely get centered in the books I read the way eragon and saphira’s friendship is centered, particularly because romantic relationships usually get the spotlight. Especially inter gender friendships! Like, it’s kinda refreshing to have saphira be a dragon and therefore not a sexual object tbh. Kinda sad that a femme character has to be a dragon to not get sexualized lol but still. 

Oh ugh one other complaint that that reminds me of- **slight spoilers** I’m having a hard time discerning how I feel about Arya specifically in this book bc I know the future but at the very least she’s kinda creepily sexualized? But I think it’s also kiiiinda okay bc it’s through the perspective of a 16 year old boy? Idk the whole vibes are kinda off, but it wasn’t a super centered part of eragon so so far so good. **end spoilers** 

Anyway, I genuinely thought a lot of the action sequences were exciting, the stakes felt pretty real given **spoilersish** all the character deaths **end spoilers**, and I’m just SUCH a sucker for kinda meandering season one adventures vibes. Just my favorite part of the hero’s journey lol, I love a good training sequence. And I do think the magic system is awesome. I think I remember learning about it as a kid and being like “THIS IS THE COOLEST THING EVER WHATS MY TRUE NAME”, so again I’m biased. But yknow. I think both eragon and saphira felt very 3D and imperfectly endearing, the other side characters were also relatively well fleshed out and interesting, and I was super sad when I finished and didn’t immediately have access to the next book. Again, not claiming this is “objectively” an amazing book because it’s so hard for me to separate my nostalgia from my current feelings, but I genuinely had a wonderful time reading the book and I feel like I got something new out of this reread than I ever have before. And I do think there’s a reason this was my favorite book as a kid- I see the origin of my love of rich world building, magic rules, and, duh, DRAGONS!! Dragons are SO cool. Very excited for the next book!
