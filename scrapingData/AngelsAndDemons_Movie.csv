0,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.

So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.

Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.

The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.

Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.

Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Satisfying pop-corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular.",Average,tom hanks returns dan brown symbologist robert langdon first adventure angels demons hollywood decided make da vinci code given latter controversial subject striking raw nerve faith catholic church arms first film seemingly nonchalant one hard see considering ron howard opted action piece serves great tourism video rome vatican city would probably boost visitor numbers given many beautiful scenes save st peter square basilica scaled model used guess bulk budget going toward sets ensemble cast correspondingly scaled ayelet zurer tried step female void left audrey tautou given tautou character lot stake film zurer scientist vittoria lot less waiting wings change batteries canister filled book fodder course langdon converse vast knowledge vatican illuminati great feud two neither love interest intellectual equal ewan mcgregor hand chews scene camerlengo patrick mckenna temporarily taking care papal office prominent cardinals sistine chapel elect new pope plays patrick glint eye nuances enough let know meets eye surprises readers novel mcgregor performance one highlights film hanks plays well tom hanks book rich arguably accurate content always lot plot points science versus religion wealth information dan brown researched linked together engaging fictional piece work reading book years ago thought film made easy lapse dwell set action pieces sadly ron howard film pace allow temporary breather unlike first film characters sit discussion time cup tea one moved things along quickly like reading book page page skipped get thick action catholic reviewers called angels demons harmless guess dwell many controversies unlike da vinci code struck raw nerve centre faith anything film served great tourism promotional video nice showcase many prominent touristy landmarks would entice many around world go pay visit naturally certain areas like catacombs beneath st peter basilica vatican archives remain bounds walk along path illumination almost free nothing new read book see come alive film may compel pick dan brown novel read bit significance landmarks characters galileo michelangelo bernini intricately linked plot much left unsaid satisfying entertainment leaving nothing spectacular,True
1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.

2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,5.0,"I am sorry for all the readers, but I don't know where to begin.

Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.

A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.

Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.

You would think that with a running time of about 140 minutes a movie is able to bring more. Much more.",Average,sorry readers know begin let say first big dan brown fan read angels demons great pleasure book deals lot eternal question science vs religion made think lot subject big battle totally lost movie lot important lines book cern maximilian kohler scepsis swiss guard love relationship robert vittoria hassassin relationship camerlengo pope lost movie screenplay makes movie version would movie good read book still doubt scene movie without interruption time contemplation depth backgrounds chase movie great decorum would think running time minutes movie able bring much,True
3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. This is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second.

4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.

The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.

Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.

Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.

This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.

The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.

This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.

Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.

It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.

Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.

5,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"Adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, a follow-up to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code"", has so much plot exposition, location trotting, CGI effects and elaborate camera set-ups in the first thirty minutes, one is apt to be blown away or perhaps toppled over by the breathless racing about. Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled. It is an expensive picture, burnished and foreboding, however it's about as intrinsically satisfying as junk food--and just as bad for you.

6,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.

With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.

Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.

Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.

The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.

Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.

If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",Good,da vinci code introduced us robert langdon knack solving puzzles angels demons ups ante providing huge puzzle hour limit cast award winning actors ron howard good job directing story easy follow even easier accept da vinci code threw many angles short time quick bathroom break would leave bit confused return feel angels demons plot action kept interest level peaked throughout cardinal strauss armin easily favorite character movie portrayal elitist yet misunderstood rank catholic church good combined victim treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor find choosing sides immediately upon introduction great amount tom hanks time film focuses story character development well enough introduction first movie unfortunately found ayelet zurer character vittoria vetra unnecessary femme assistant quest since lines bit limited seemed much like afterthought play key role beginning things soon fades background langdon familiar necessary partner plot one organizations catholic church wronged past quite sought revenge artistic manner men church kidnapped set executed specific times ultimate end church happen robert landon brought help decipher clues teams beautiful vittoria vetra scientist witnessed colleague die hands church enemy music staying relevant cinematography beautiful could chime menial things makes angels demons absolutely work conclusion far one amazingly surprising endings seen movie impressed hit like anyone else appreciate great movie wraps quite tight drops pretty bow needless say left theater pleased movie entirety religious unsure movie offend catholic principles say davinci code painted catholicism shady group sadists angels demons paints much lighter brush church shown collective good men made suffer sins evil misguided men wore colors even infiltrated modern ranks,True

The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.

You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. If you haven't read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. And if you have read the book, well lets say you might be a little let down because I found many scenes missing that I was looking forward to.

But Angels & Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.

The story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic.

9,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"It's now been three years since Tom Hanks as Dr. Robert Langdon solved the mystery of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that Audrey Tautou from The DaVinci Code is their descendant. You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.

But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.

So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.

Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.

10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"I go to the movies to be entertained. I was very entertained by the first film in this series: The DaVinci Code. It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well. Angels and Demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film, but faster paced, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.

What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable. If there is one thing that I didn't like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable (don't want to give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what I saw.

11,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.

Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead.

Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors).

The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.

Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?).

12,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.

The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.

The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.

AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.

The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.

It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.

13,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!

Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.

As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.

I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!

Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.

14,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.

Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.

Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance. All flaws aside, I can certainly see future generations enjoying 'Angels and Demons' for its preposterous sense of fun.",Average,robert langdon back better ever better mean finally got haircut ron howard da vinci code released amid storm controversy snagged million suffered crucifixion hands critics worldwide remember film well inspired first time discuss length film merits better worse howard ardent defender howard demons adapted sequel opened polite smattering debate better films comfortably enjoyed exactly entertaining pulp thrillers replete exotic locations beautiful women brutal murders ancient conspiracies treasure hunts race time owing source novel limited reputation demons lacks bloated whether conscious predecessor enjoyed without reservation fanciful unpretentious screenwriters david koepp akiva goldsman shorn majority dan brown ludicrous plot twists fortunately substitute would sent audience eyes rolling even film remains thematically inconsistent flaw extends back source material brown originally published angels demons transition writing style digital fortress deception point pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers government organisations using technology perpetrate crimes threaten heroine da vinci code elements discarded favour historical documents religious iconography angels demons finds stranded middle conversion labouring extensively fictional antimatter explosions simple bomb would done nicely juxtaposition history technology may well intentional used emphasise conflict science religion nonetheless imbalance tone jars violently viewer tom hanks reprises role harvard symbologist robert langdon performance improvement rather existing purely cypher ancient symbols langdon seems developed fuller persona though awkward attempts defining stance religion supporting players ewan mcgregor aylet zurer stellan skarsgård pierfrancesco favino dependable without attempting steal limelight ian mckellen successfully da vinci code nikolaj lie kaas illuminati assassin quite feel part lacking ghostly creepiness paul bettany equivalent role salvatore totino cinematography handsome see year nevertheless captures art architecture rome vatican whether real recreated stunning vibrancy hans zimmer score energetic emphatic right moments underscoring events film forcefully stamping significance flaws aside certainly see future generations enjoying demons preposterous sense fun,True

The symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and the scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), who had her powerful and dangerous prototype of antimatter research stolen, are invited by the Vatican police to help them in their investigation. They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.

The novel and bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I have read. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of that complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable and the movie frustrated my expectations. I have not read ""Angels & Demons"", and I liked very much this film. The story has many plot points in wonderful locations; the acting is excellent and holds the attention until the last sequence.

16,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.

Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.

Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.

The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",Average,doubt ron howard great hero movie proved truly professional skilled director perfectly understood nature dan brown novel aim production thus result well made well performed product certainly top movie dan brown wrote impressive thriller made action suspense paradoxical surprising twists aim selling ron howard spares effort succeeds rendering thrilling engaging story based well consolidated narrative outline find trustworthy hero robert langdon capable unraveling every mysterious sign leading us shocking finale everything course sounds excessive crescendo excess limit ridiculous worth underlining typical capability hollywood great productions take job seriously make good product nothing viewer conscious real nature displayed counts final result aesthetically good entertaining movie indeed evidently movie like book represents threat unbreakable solidness roman catholic church even less faith real faithful people fears reluctance clerical authorities movie distributed sounded little excessive indeed end even romano gave favourable review even movie least offers new interesting perspective ancient let admit quite probably fashion dichotomy science religion pretext build strong till end entertaining story still able attract millions viewers world remaining nonsense forgivable whole cast prove good performances tom hanks certainty beginning however opinion ewan macgregor camerlengo interesting character one langdon interesting exchange faith actors even pierfrancesco favino contribute enthralling atmosphere story,True

18,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.

So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.

Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.

The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.

Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.

Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid.

I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.

Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.

A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.

Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.

I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think.

22,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.

The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.

Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.

Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.

This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.

The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.

This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.

Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.

It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.

Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.

Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled.

24,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.

With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.

Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.

Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.

The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.

Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.

If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",Good,da vinci code introduced us robert langdon knack solving puzzles angels demons ups ante providing huge puzzle hour limit cast award winning actors ron howard good job directing story easy follow even easier accept da vinci code threw many angles short time quick bathroom break would leave bit confused return feel angels demons plot action kept interest level peaked throughout cardinal strauss armin easily favorite character movie portrayal elitist yet misunderstood rank catholic church good combined victim treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor find choosing sides immediately upon introduction great amount tom hanks time film focuses story character development well enough introduction first movie unfortunately found ayelet zurer character vittoria vetra unnecessary femme assistant quest since lines bit limited seemed much like afterthought play key role beginning things soon fades background langdon familiar necessary partner plot one organizations catholic church wronged past quite sought revenge artistic manner men church kidnapped set executed specific times ultimate end church happen robert landon brought help decipher clues teams beautiful vittoria vetra scientist witnessed colleague die hands church enemy music staying relevant cinematography beautiful could chime menial things makes angels demons absolutely work conclusion far one amazingly surprising endings seen movie impressed hit like anyone else appreciate great movie wraps quite tight drops pretty bow needless say left theater pleased movie entirety religious unsure movie offend catholic principles say davinci code painted catholicism shady group sadists angels demons paints much lighter brush church shown collective good men made suffer sins evil misguided men wore colors even infiltrated modern ranks,True

The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.

You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.

You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.

But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.

So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.

Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.

What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable.

29,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.

Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead.

Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors).

The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.

Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?).

30,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.

The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.

The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.

AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.

The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.

It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.

31,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!

Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.

As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.

I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!

Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.

32,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.

Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.

Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance.

They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.

The novel and bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I have read. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of that complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable and the movie frustrated my expectations.

Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.

Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.

The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",Average,doubt ron howard great hero movie proved truly professional skilled director perfectly understood nature dan brown novel aim production thus result well made well performed product certainly top movie dan brown wrote impressive thriller made action suspense paradoxical surprising twists aim selling ron howard spares effort succeeds rendering thrilling engaging story based well consolidated narrative outline find trustworthy hero robert langdon capable unraveling every mysterious sign leading us shocking finale everything course sounds excessive crescendo excess limit ridiculous worth underlining typical capability hollywood great productions take job seriously make good product nothing viewer conscious real nature displayed counts final result aesthetically good entertaining movie indeed evidently movie like book represents threat unbreakable solidness roman catholic church even less faith real faithful people fears reluctance clerical authorities movie distributed sounded little excessive indeed end even romano gave favourable review even movie least offers new interesting perspective ancient let admit quite probably fashion dichotomy science religion pretext build strong till end entertaining story still able attract millions viewers world remaining nonsense forgivable whole cast prove good performances tom hanks certainty beginning however opinion ewan macgregor camerlengo interesting character one langdon interesting exchange faith actors even pierfrancesco favino contribute enthralling atmosphere story,True

So with that said, this probably wasn't one of the most exciting movies I've seen this year though it did get better as the movie went on. Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go. Ron Howard provides his own compelling direction to the fore though, like I said, it didn't completely jell for me. Still, it wasn't a bad time I spent with my friend who works at the theatre seeing this film it was playing especially since, once again, I got to watch for free...

37,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by ""Angels & Demons"", the follow-up to the ludicruous ""The Da Vinci Code"", where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.

Actually a prequel of ""The Da Vinci Code"" novel, the events in ""Angels & Demons"" is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.

Lecturing and pontificating, ""Angels & Demons""' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist.

38,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"It is the mark of a truly talented director to smoothly flow between Oscar nominated dramas and big budget summer blockbusters, as is it to take the criticisms of a previous franchise instalment and buff and polish the sequel into a superior, smoother film. That is precisely what director Ron Howard does with the second Dan Brown adaptation Angels & Demons, cleverly folding what would be bloated subplots and somewhat ridiculous chapters into a more streamline narrative; mostly loyal but cleverly translated.

Howard re-unites with Tom Hanks, who again stars as symbologist Robert Langdon. A prequel to the mega-hit The Da Vinci code on paper but interpreted as a sequel on film Angels & Demons progresses more quickly, talks less, features some solid supporting performances and has a spectacular final, effects-driven climax. Alas, even with most of the right moves and even more genuine intention Howard's film is simply not as good as the book, neither in cleverness or pacing. In the novel, Langdon's revelations are able to be drawn out and incorporate far more clues and twists and turns. Moreover, the much loved science vs. religion dispute is far better utilized as are the dark history of Rome and the origins and intentions of the secret society of the Illuminati which is the true spine of the story.

Scooped up by the Vatican late one evening and jetted off to The Vatican, Robert Langdon again finds himself in danger adjacent to history, religion and ancient lore. Following the death of The Pope, and the subsequent induction of the next, an old threat rears its head once again. The ancient society of The Illuminati has come for revenge after centuries of suppression and secret annihilation at the hands of the church. Marring the ancient tradition of papal election is the kidnapping of the four preferiti (the cardinals most favoured to success the late Pope) and a bomb threat which could boast a devastating end to Vatican City. Langdon follows the ancient clues of the Illuminati along with a lovely scientist (Ayelet Zurer) who created the bomb which now threatens them all, Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Camerlengo McKenna (an excellent Ewan McGregor) the Pope's temporary successor and adopted son. Time runs out as Langdon and his team race to recover the four Cardinals held by a deadly Illuminati assassin (who if I may say is completely badass) and ultimately the bomb.

Aside from the understandable nuances lost in the adaptation, a number of climatic elements were dropped that I found somewhat disappointing. I will not reveal them here, but if you are a fan you will pick them out easily. Thankfully though this will serve as no detriment to those not experienced with the Dan Brown's works and should still unfold as a satisfying finale. Technically, Angels & Demons is impeccable as are the shots of Rome and The Vatican. Howard's choice to assemble an international cast and not concern himself with cramming countless A list stars into the production is admirable and ultimately an asset. Hanks is adequate but is overshadowed by McGregor but helps the cast round out nicely in the end. This will not likely be the last we will see of Robert Langdon and here is hoping Howard et al can one-up themselves again and cap off an entertaining, if uneven, mystery trilogy.

39,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.

The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter.

The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way.

The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets.

However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost).

While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder.

A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.

40,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,2.0,"Angels & Demons (2009) is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling mystery-thriller novel of the same title hat is based on the dark secrets in the history of Catholicism and the fight of the Catholic Church against the underground societies and their influence. There is a lot to like in the new film: the pace is very fast and appropriately so, the views of Rome and its historical and art treasures are gorgeous, as well as the look into Vatican chambers, passages, and catacombs. The lecture which was given by Ewan McGregor (who looked very appealing as a young priest) about history of struggle between Catholic Church and mysterious powerful secret society of ""Illuminati"" over the Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years, or the religion against the science, was quite insightful and illuminating. Tom Hanks who reprised the role of the Harvard Professor Robert Langdon with the obvious gift for solving tricky puzzles and finding the meaning of secret symbols was once again on hand to provide the solution for yet another Catholic Church serious crisis that threatens the very existence of Vatican City and the college of cardinals who gathered from all over the world to elect the new Pope . I should admit that I liked Hanks in this movie much better than in the first adaptation of Dan Brown's historic- religious mystery ""Da Vinci Code"". I also found Angels & Demons much more fun to watch, maybe because in the new film, its creators concentrate on the crime/mystery/thriller/action elements and did not try to add much drama to it.

41,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"A few years ago there was The Davinci Code. In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.

All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.

42,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Three years after the Dan Brown novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" appeared as a film which took a staggering $760 million, another of his books receives the large screen treatment. Although Brown wrote ""Angels & Demons"" first, the film version represents this story, which is sympathetic to the Catholic Church, as following ""The Da Vinci Code"" which was seen as hostile to the Church. Whatever the difference in stance towards Catholicism, Brown's work is always terribly formulaic: a twisting plot set over a matter of hours, lots of symbols and signs, considerable running, much desecration of the flesh, the counterbalancing of religion and science, minimal characterisation, and changing perception of key characters. This time it's all cardinals, cathedrals, crypts and catacombs plus a camerlengo scattered over central Rome and the Vatican.

Again Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist does his best with a wooden script (but a better haircut) - at least ""Angels & Demons"" is less wordy than ""The Da Vinci Code"". Again there is only one female character - this time Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer). Scottish Ewan McGregor (who struggles to affect a Northern Irish accent), German Armin Mueller-Stahl and Swedish Stellan Skarsgård each play Vatican officials who may be an angel or a demon. It's hard to work out which is the greatest threat: the Illuminati, an anti-matter bomb or the implausibilities of the plot. Papal bull or curate's egg? - you decide.

The race is on as Ron Howard's multi-million dollar blockbuster sequel finally hits the big screen. We last saw Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) 3 years ago, when he uncovered the truth behind a secret society. Now, he's called on once again. This time the stakes are higher, the case is deadlier and the mystery is unlike anything he's witnessed. Here, he's called to Rome to study a mysterious death of one of the 4 cardinals. Little does he know that he's tangled up in a war between the Catholic Church and a Secret Society known as the Illuminati (the enemy to the Catholic Church.) He soon learns that a member of Illuminati has kidnapped 3 other cardinals, threatening to kill one an hour and seizing to destroy Vatican City when the conclave begins. There on he goes on the hunt with a brilliant Scientist (Ayelet Zurer) followed by mysterious twists, turns and deaths headed their way. The only question is can they stop the attack in time? Ron Howard's Angels and Demons is better than his first outing (Da Vinci Code) in every single way possible. It's better in terms of quality, story, and entertainment. The suspense started very early (unlike the slow moving Da Vinci Code) and has enough action and great shots of the Vatican to keep you in your seat for at least 2 hours. Think of it as National Treasure meets 24 in Rome. Despite its potential, it also does has some flaws. It's still preachy, preposterous, and somewhat predictable. Did I mention it also felt like it went on for longer than it needed to be? If you're an open minded person, and often use ""That can never happen"" then you then you may want to take this one off your alley.

45,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"I'd heard the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code movie, never read the book, never saw it at the theatre, eventually hired it on DVD (remember hiring DVDs?) and...was pretty bored by it. I've come around to not-minding it on subsequent viewings when it's been repeated numerous times on TV, but I much prefer this second film. I saw this one at the theatre, hadn't read the book...which I think helped me enjoy the movie, as I felt this one was the most interesting/had the best pacing and actually felt like a proper movie mystery/thriller. It's my favourite of the trilogy and the one I've rewatched the most. I think, as a whole, Angels & Demons is just a better-told film. It isn't slow-paced/plodding along with a drawn-out conclusion like The Da Vinci Code was. Although Ron Howard directed all three films in the trilogy, *this* is the one that kept me interested throughout (even during the 'slower' moments). Tom Hanks seems more at ease in his role as Robert Langdon this time around; his likeability ensuring the audience *cares* what happens to him, and his delivery of exposition (of which there is quite a lot) thankfully didn't ever really bore me. I never saw what the big deal was about his hair in the first film, but any who feared that his 'do would be the 'demon' from the title of this film needn't fear, as it's shorter now.

The biggest improvement with this film over its predecessor, I thought, was Langdon's female partner he's paired with this time around. As the intelligent and beautiful Vittoria Vetra (who I found much more interesting than Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu from the first film), Ayelet Zurer is more of an 'equal' to Hanks's Langdon. They make quite the team, and Vittoria proves that she can indeed keep up with him (which is especially impressive since, as I heard Tom Hanks himself say during a radio interview when the film was being released, 'like every beautiful particle physicist...she wears Manolo Blahniks whilst running on cobblestone'). It's a bit of a shame, however, that unlike the beginning and end of the film, the middle is spent with her character and Langdon separated. After enjoying the two of them onscreen together so much at the start of the movie, I was disappointed they split up for what felt like quite a long period of time midway through. The actors have a nice chemistry, there's an ease/comfortableness between them, and I was amused during one scene that showed Vittoria's much more blunt/direct approach to getting what they needed as quickly as possible and Langdon's reaction to it. The two of them also obviously got a lot of exercise during filming, given all the running around that's involved.

Ewan McGregor is another actor who brings an instant likeability to his character, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, and I think the movie benefited from this considering the direction in which the film goes with him. It's important we *like* him. McGregor really owned the last third of the film with his performance, I felt. While there are other somewhat important characters in the movie, I felt these main three were the most memorable. Unfortunately, I wasn't as interested in this movie's bad guy; The Assassin (because *all* of these movies HAVE to have one of those, apparently). Nikolaj Lie Kaas wasn't as intriguing a villain as Paul Bettany's albino monk, Silas, was in the first film (though at least this assassin gives a *reason* for not killing Langdon, despite having several chances to do so, rather than it just being because he's the lead and therefore has plot armour/can't die). Stellan Skarsgård (who I like in some films, but not others) wasn't overly likable here either. Much better were the characters of Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt, who it was fun to notice in this movie after having seen him years later in Seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series Bron/Broen aka The Bridge). His character shares quite a memorably tense scene with Langdon at one point and Lindhardt ensures that his character makes an impact despite limited screentime.

This movie has a sense of humour that the first film didn't, but it's certainly not a laugh riot either, as there are several instances of gruesomeness, thus making it a far more intense film than the first. Hans Zimmer's score helps sell the suspense. The FX used in this movie illustrate the way CGI *should* be used (to help *add* to the film, rather than distract from it). The climax of the movie isn't quite what you might be expecting, as there's more to the story than first appears, and so long as you don't have a problem with reading subtitles, you should enjoy this film.

46,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"While ""Angels & Demons"" is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.

From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, ""Angels"" is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of ""Da Vinci,"" especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.

Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to ""Angels & Demons,"" the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.

Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece.",Poor,angels demons means great film least manages consistently solid places head tails sorry predecessor mildly creepy opening mildly exciting finish angels fairly effective thriller plot bears quite similarities da vinci especially concerning supporting characters introduce strong device present first film stop robert langdon journey rome works excellent director howard seems scenes good feel eerie suspense gruesome reveals furthermore plot takes whole new direction lasts fitting slightly underwhelming climax thusly plot proceeds first frame last following part footsteps professor langdon played pretentiously yet tom hanks seems harvard professor one must bitterly sarcastic everyone deliver dragging monologues history long overstay welcome fact according angels demons said camerlengos ewan mcgregor plays film camerlengo convincingly pouring endless dull speeches nature faith mankind fault case lies wholly hands screenplay strangely enough however screenplay gives words vittoria vetra apparent female lead played inoffensively zuret stellan skarsgard armin fortunately fare better roles despite shortcomings areas cast delivers whole leading one wonder film better real culprit twist worthy dan brown novel screenplay movie drags minutes matching inspired thrill monologue piece unnecessary historical jargon beautiful shots beat bad pacing case fact forty minutes film could scraped away great effect sadly said forty minutes cut film bad masterpiece,True
47,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,5.0,"I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.

There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.

Although they did film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.

This movie should be received better by the critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie.",Average,premier movie last night rome expert book however great deal changes book movie pacing movie much faster davinci code many things trimmed otherwise would hour movie many things also changed give movie fast pace think matters feel movie works well hanks brown company things book would appear implausible movie form giving spoilers except say ending movie handled slightly different way leonardo vetra found also different see movie might interested reading book get full details story minor details also cut movie although film rome recreate interior shots since went walking tour rome day movie say interior sites authentic look feel kohler movie much shown cern hanks good job interesting scenes involving vatican archives course access area sure anyone actually knows vatican archives look like eyelet zurer break movie victoria vetra good job eye candy hanks movie received better critics public never know ron howard mentioned several times interviews saw cast movie movie,True
48,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"The Da Vinci Code movie was received with a mixture of enthusiasm and disappointment when it first arrived. The fans of the book couldn't wait for it, the Catholic church were going mad about it being released, and the average person was being shepherded to see a movie that they just wanted to know what all the media attention was about. I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit I was looking forward to it. I loved the book and wanted to see a great adaptation. I admit I enjoyed the movie, though a lot really didn't, but I will admit its slow moving, a bit tedious and way, way too faithful to the book. However I had read Dan Brown's other Langdon novel before Da Vinci Code, and I always found Angels and Demons the far superior story. And so here is the inevitable adaptation, and much like the books I prefer Angels and Demons. Demons is a fast paced, beautifully shot and brilliantly acted piece of popcorn entertainment. Yes it has its flaws, the story is still a bit all over the place, and various changes from the novel are not very welcome in my eyes. But for the most part this is a piece of superior entertainment, and after the disaster of Wolverine it is nice to see a sequel with a bit of thought behind it.

So onto the acting. First off is Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. First things first, the hair has been improved, I know that was a huge distraction for a lot of people in its predecessor. Hanks is pretty good here, I'm not going to lie and say he's incredible, as sadly Langdon isn't the greatest character ever. His motivations are vague at best. Still for the material he is given he makes the most of it. Ewan McGregor gets a great role in this movie, he was always the character that intrigued me most in the novel and McGregor does him justice. I won't spoil about him, but you understand after the halfway mark why such a famous actor was cast in the seemingly unimportant role. Ayelet Zurer does a great job as Vittoria Vetra, but the lack of screen time she gets in comparison to how much she is in the book really did frustrate me. Stellan Skarsgård is a bit wasted and I'm not too sure why he signed on for it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl is my personal favourite, have never really encountered the actor before, but his performance definitely is a highlight.

The key to Angels and Demons superiority is in the pacing. Da Vinci Code had very sluggish moments and too many endings for its own good. Here the movie is set over a night, and it works all the better for it. The plot zips along, and all the talky dialogue is usually done while driving or running to the next location to prevent a murder. The murders themselves are shot superbly, although the Air murder is nowhere near as gory as depicted in the novel. The Fire and Water murders are superb though. I liked the execution of the twist for the most part, and I don't think it was as blatantly obvious as I feared, considering it completely threw me when I read the book. The helicopter bit from the novel however is still ludicrous, and the whole antimatter scenario is a OTT for its own good. But these are the flaws of the novel, and at least the ridiculous divine intervention garbage has been scrapped.

Overall Angels and Demons is a fun thrill ride for the summer. Its a superior movie to Da Vinci Code, and I just hope The Lost Symbol (the upcoming Dan Brown novel) is good enough to warrant Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to sign on for yet another one.",Good,da vinci code movie received mixture enthusiasm disappointment first arrived fans book could wait catholic church going mad released average person shepherded see movie wanted know media attention first put hands admit looking forward loved book wanted see great adaptation admit enjoyed movie though lot really admit slow moving bit tedious way way faithful book however read dan brown langdon novel da vinci code always found angels demons far superior story inevitable adaptation much like books prefer angels demons demons fast paced beautifully shot brilliantly acted piece popcorn entertainment yes flaws story still bit place various changes novel welcome eyes part piece superior entertainment disaster wolverine nice see sequel bit thought behind onto acting first tom hanks robert langdon first things first hair improved know huge distraction lot people predecessor hanks pretty good going lie say incredible sadly langdon greatest character ever motivations vague best still material given makes ewan mcgregor gets great role movie always character intrigued novel mcgregor justice wo spoil understand halfway mark famous actor cast seemingly unimportant role ayelet zurer great job vittoria vetra lack screen time gets comparison much book really frustrate stellan skarsgård bit wasted sure signed armin personal favourite never really encountered actor performance definitely highlight key angels demons superiority pacing da vinci code sluggish moments many endings good movie set night works better plot zips along talky dialogue usually done driving running next location prevent murder murders shot superbly although air murder nowhere near gory depicted novel fire water murders superb though liked execution twist part think blatantly obvious feared considering completely threw read book helicopter bit novel however still ludicrous whole antimatter scenario ott good flaws novel least ridiculous divine intervention garbage scrapped overall angels demons fun thrill ride summer superior movie da vinci code hope lost symbol upcoming dan brown novel good enough warrant ron howard tom hanks sign yet another one,True
49,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.

Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a ""wait, it's at the chapel"" or ""Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!"" or ""No, that's not it, it's in the sewer"" or ""Wait, it's in my hat!""

It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.

Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was ""message"" like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero.",Average,angels demons follows heels da vinci code movie something really excited either way case macguffin leading characters silly adventure yes make mistake silliness disguised pompous seriousness jesus christ virgin mary fallacy well cube blow vatican city macguffin used way hitchcock clever meant used ideal science religion illuminatti war catholic church going use piece science blah blah whatever put mildly macguffin like would fine use characters story transparent go much focus review something simple angels demons exciting thriller drama twists turns happen rapidly much exposition swear screenwriters trying law order indeed would even blame dan brown dull jerkiness plot read book assume original text might fun way airplane paperback books move along pieces food thought also indeed consensus angels demons better book da vinci code even less controversial cinema something else every five minutes get wait chapel wait church give map sewer wait hat constant string gotchas guided suspenseful hand slick hollywood filmmaker ron howard made good movies day beautiful mind even star tom hanks apollo slightly element frankly hacks way thicket plot points explanation occasional moments striking hanks knocking one glass windows ever hard break losing oxygen vatican archives ultimately really get dan brown may wanted see sense looking religion catholicism seeing hypocrisies underneath science rules secretly would bad thing let people see science academia rules superstitions lasted millenia long ultimately already leaving mind part happened message like really compelling another rickety blockbuster machine really please hardcore fans book looking tom hanks superhero,True
50,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.

The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.

And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.

Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.

The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.

Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD.

51,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.

So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.

Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.

The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.

Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.

Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid.

I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.

Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.

A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.

Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.

I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think.

55,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.

The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.

Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.

Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.

This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.

The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.

This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.

Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.

It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.

Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.

56,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"Adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, a follow-up to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code"", has so much plot exposition, location trotting, CGI effects and elaborate camera set-ups in the first thirty minutes, one is apt to be blown away or perhaps toppled over by the breathless racing about. Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled.

57,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.

With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.

Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.

Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.

The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.

Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.

If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",Good,da vinci code introduced us robert langdon knack solving puzzles angels demons ups ante providing huge puzzle hour limit cast award winning actors ron howard good job directing story easy follow even easier accept da vinci code threw many angles short time quick bathroom break would leave bit confused return feel angels demons plot action kept interest level peaked throughout cardinal strauss armin easily favorite character movie portrayal elitist yet misunderstood rank catholic church good combined victim treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor find choosing sides immediately upon introduction great amount tom hanks time film focuses story character development well enough introduction first movie unfortunately found ayelet zurer character vittoria vetra unnecessary femme assistant quest since lines bit limited seemed much like afterthought play key role beginning things soon fades background langdon familiar necessary partner plot one organizations catholic church wronged past quite sought revenge artistic manner men church kidnapped set executed specific times ultimate end church happen robert landon brought help decipher clues teams beautiful vittoria vetra scientist witnessed colleague die hands church enemy music staying relevant cinematography beautiful could chime menial things makes angels demons absolutely work conclusion far one amazingly surprising endings seen movie impressed hit like anyone else appreciate great movie wraps quite tight drops pretty bow needless say left theater pleased movie entirety religious unsure movie offend catholic principles say davinci code painted catholicism shady group sadists angels demons paints much lighter brush church shown collective good men made suffer sins evil misguided men wore colors even infiltrated modern ranks,True

The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.

You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.

You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.

But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.

So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.

Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.

Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.

What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable.

62,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.

Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead.

Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors).

The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.

Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?).

63,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.

The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.

The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.

AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.

The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.

It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.

64,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!

Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.

As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.

I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!

Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.

65,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.

Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.

Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance.

They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.

The novel and bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I have read. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of that complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable and the movie frustrated my expectations. I have not read ""Angels & Demons"", and I liked very much this film. The story has many plot points in wonderful locations; the acting is excellent and holds the attention until the last sequence. My daughter read the novel and told me that the adaptation is also frustrating. My vote is eight.

67,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.

Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.

Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.

The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",Average,doubt ron howard great hero movie proved truly professional skilled director perfectly understood nature dan brown novel aim production thus result well made well performed product certainly top movie dan brown wrote impressive thriller made action suspense paradoxical surprising twists aim selling ron howard spares effort succeeds rendering thrilling engaging story based well consolidated narrative outline find trustworthy hero robert langdon capable unraveling every mysterious sign leading us shocking finale everything course sounds excessive crescendo excess limit ridiculous worth underlining typical capability hollywood great productions take job seriously make good product nothing viewer conscious real nature displayed counts final result aesthetically good entertaining movie indeed evidently movie like book represents threat unbreakable solidness roman catholic church even less faith real faithful people fears reluctance clerical authorities movie distributed sounded little excessive indeed end even romano gave favourable review even movie least offers new interesting perspective ancient let admit quite probably fashion dichotomy science religion pretext build strong till end entertaining story still able attract millions viewers world remaining nonsense forgivable whole cast prove good performances tom hanks certainty beginning however opinion ewan macgregor camerlengo interesting character one langdon interesting exchange faith actors even pierfrancesco favino contribute enthralling atmosphere story,True

Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go.

70,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by ""Angels & Demons"", the follow-up to the ludicruous ""The Da Vinci Code"", where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.

Actually a prequel of ""The Da Vinci Code"" novel, the events in ""Angels & Demons"" is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.

Lecturing and pontificating, ""Angels & Demons""' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist.

71,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"It is the mark of a truly talented director to smoothly flow between Oscar nominated dramas and big budget summer blockbusters, as is it to take the criticisms of a previous franchise instalment and buff and polish the sequel into a superior, smoother film. That is precisely what director Ron Howard does with the second Dan Brown adaptation Angels & Demons, cleverly folding what would be bloated subplots and somewhat ridiculous chapters into a more streamline narrative; mostly loyal but cleverly translated.

Howard re-unites with Tom Hanks, who again stars as symbologist Robert Langdon. A prequel to the mega-hit The Da Vinci code on paper but interpreted as a sequel on film Angels & Demons progresses more quickly, talks less, features some solid supporting performances and has a spectacular final, effects-driven climax. Alas, even with most of the right moves and even more genuine intention Howard's film is simply not as good as the book, neither in cleverness or pacing. In the novel, Langdon's revelations are able to be drawn out and incorporate far more clues and twists and turns. Moreover, the much loved science vs. religion dispute is far better utilized as are the dark history of Rome and the origins and intentions of the secret society of the Illuminati which is the true spine of the story.

Scooped up by the Vatican late one evening and jetted off to The Vatican, Robert Langdon again finds himself in danger adjacent to history, religion and ancient lore. Following the death of The Pope, and the subsequent induction of the next, an old threat rears its head once again. The ancient society of The Illuminati has come for revenge after centuries of suppression and secret annihilation at the hands of the church. Marring the ancient tradition of papal election is the kidnapping of the four preferiti (the cardinals most favoured to success the late Pope) and a bomb threat which could boast a devastating end to Vatican City. Langdon follows the ancient clues of the Illuminati along with a lovely scientist (Ayelet Zurer) who created the bomb which now threatens them all, Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Camerlengo McKenna (an excellent Ewan McGregor) the Pope's temporary successor and adopted son. Time runs out as Langdon and his team race to recover the four Cardinals held by a deadly Illuminati assassin (who if I may say is completely badass) and ultimately the bomb.

Aside from the understandable nuances lost in the adaptation, a number of climatic elements were dropped that I found somewhat disappointing. I will not reveal them here, but if you are a fan you will pick them out easily. Thankfully though this will serve as no detriment to those not experienced with the Dan Brown's works and should still unfold as a satisfying finale. Technically, Angels & Demons is impeccable as are the shots of Rome and The Vatican. Howard's choice to assemble an international cast and not concern himself with cramming countless A list stars into the production is admirable and ultimately an asset. Hanks is adequate but is overshadowed by McGregor but helps the cast round out nicely in the end. This will not likely be the last we will see of Robert Langdon and here is hoping Howard et al can one-up themselves again and cap off an entertaining, if uneven, mystery trilogy.

72,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.

The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter.

The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way.

The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets.

However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost).

While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder.

A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.

73,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,2.0,"Angels & Demons (2009) is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling mystery-thriller novel of the same title hat is based on the dark secrets in the history of Catholicism and the fight of the Catholic Church against the underground societies and their influence. There is a lot to like in the new film: the pace is very fast and appropriately so, the views of Rome and its historical and art treasures are gorgeous, as well as the look into Vatican chambers, passages, and catacombs. The lecture which was given by Ewan McGregor (who looked very appealing as a young priest) about history of struggle between Catholic Church and mysterious powerful secret society of ""Illuminati"" over the Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years, or the religion against the science, was quite insightful and illuminating. Tom Hanks who reprised the role of the Harvard Professor Robert Langdon with the obvious gift for solving tricky puzzles and finding the meaning of secret symbols was once again on hand to provide the solution for yet another Catholic Church serious crisis that threatens the very existence of Vatican City and the college of cardinals who gathered from all over the world to elect the new Pope . I should admit that I liked Hanks in this movie much better than in the first adaptation of Dan Brown's historic- religious mystery ""Da Vinci Code"". I also found Angels & Demons much more fun to watch, maybe because in the new film, its creators concentrate on the crime/mystery/thriller/action elements and did not try to add much drama to it.

In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.

All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.

Although Brown wrote ""Angels & Demons"" first, the film version represents this story, which is sympathetic to the Catholic Church, as following ""The Da Vinci Code"" which was seen as hostile to the Church. Whatever the difference in stance towards Catholicism, Brown's work is always terribly formulaic: a twisting plot set over a matter of hours, lots of symbols and signs, considerable running, much desecration of the flesh, the counterbalancing of religion and science, minimal characterisation, and changing perception of key characters. This time it's all cardinals, cathedrals, crypts and catacombs plus a camerlengo scattered over central Rome and the Vatican.

Again Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist does his best with a wooden script (but a better haircut) - at least ""Angels & Demons"" is less wordy than ""The Da Vinci Code"". Again there is only one female character - this time Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer). Scottish Ewan McGregor (who struggles to affect a Northern Irish accent), German Armin Mueller-Stahl and Swedish Stellan Skarsgård each play Vatican officials who may be an angel or a demon. It's hard to work out which is the greatest threat: the Illuminati, an anti-matter bomb or the implausibilities of the plot. Papal bull or curate's egg? - you decide.

The race is on as Ron Howard's multi-million dollar blockbuster sequel finally hits the big screen. We last saw Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) 3 years ago, when he uncovered the truth behind a secret society. Now, he's called on once again. This time the stakes are higher, the case is deadlier and the mystery is unlike anything he's witnessed. Here, he's called to Rome to study a mysterious death of one of the 4 cardinals. Little does he know that he's tangled up in a war between the Catholic Church and a Secret Society known as the Illuminati (the enemy to the Catholic Church.) He soon learns that a member of Illuminati has kidnapped 3 other cardinals, threatening to kill one an hour and seizing to destroy Vatican City when the conclave begins. There on he goes on the hunt with a brilliant Scientist (Ayelet Zurer) followed by mysterious twists, turns and deaths headed their way. The only question is can they stop the attack in time? Ron Howard's Angels and Demons is better than his first outing (Da Vinci Code) in every single way possible. It's better in terms of quality, story, and entertainment. The suspense started very early (unlike the slow moving Da Vinci Code) and has enough action and great shots of the Vatican to keep you in your seat for at least 2 hours. Think of it as National Treasure meets 24 in Rome. Despite its potential, it also does has some flaws. It's still preachy, preposterous, and somewhat predictable. Did I mention it also felt like it went on for longer than it needed to be? If you're an open minded person, and often use ""That can never happen"" then you then you may want to take this one off your alley.

78,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"I'd heard the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code movie, never read the book, never saw it at the theatre, eventually hired it on DVD (remember hiring DVDs?) and...was pretty bored by it. I've come around to not-minding it on subsequent viewings when it's been repeated numerous times on TV, but I much prefer this second film. I saw this one at the theatre, hadn't read the book...which I think helped me enjoy the movie, as I felt this one was the most interesting/had the best pacing and actually felt like a proper movie mystery/thriller. It's my favourite of the trilogy and the one I've rewatched the most. I think, as a whole, Angels & Demons is just a better-told film. It isn't slow-paced/plodding along with a drawn-out conclusion like The Da Vinci Code was. Although Ron Howard directed all three films in the trilogy, *this* is the one that kept me interested throughout (even during the 'slower' moments). Tom Hanks seems more at ease in his role as Robert Langdon this time around; his likeability ensuring the audience *cares* what happens to him, and his delivery of exposition (of which there is quite a lot) thankfully didn't ever really bore me. I never saw what the big deal was about his hair in the first film, but any who feared that his 'do would be the 'demon' from the title of this film needn't fear, as it's shorter now.

The biggest improvement with this film over its predecessor, I thought, was Langdon's female partner he's paired with this time around. As the intelligent and beautiful Vittoria Vetra (who I found much more interesting than Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu from the first film), Ayelet Zurer is more of an 'equal' to Hanks's Langdon. They make quite the team, and Vittoria proves that she can indeed keep up with him (which is especially impressive since, as I heard Tom Hanks himself say during a radio interview when the film was being released, 'like every beautiful particle physicist...she wears Manolo Blahniks whilst running on cobblestone'). It's a bit of a shame, however, that unlike the beginning and end of the film, the middle is spent with her character and Langdon separated. After enjoying the two of them onscreen together so much at the start of the movie, I was disappointed they split up for what felt like quite a long period of time midway through. The actors have a nice chemistry, there's an ease/comfortableness between them, and I was amused during one scene that showed Vittoria's much more blunt/direct approach to getting what they needed as quickly as possible and Langdon's reaction to it. The two of them also obviously got a lot of exercise during filming, given all the running around that's involved.

Ewan McGregor is another actor who brings an instant likeability to his character, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, and I think the movie benefited from this considering the direction in which the film goes with him. It's important we *like* him. McGregor really owned the last third of the film with his performance, I felt. While there are other somewhat important characters in the movie, I felt these main three were the most memorable. Unfortunately, I wasn't as interested in this movie's bad guy; The Assassin (because *all* of these movies HAVE to have one of those, apparently). Nikolaj Lie Kaas wasn't as intriguing a villain as Paul Bettany's albino monk, Silas, was in the first film (though at least this assassin gives a *reason* for not killing Langdon, despite having several chances to do so, rather than it just being because he's the lead and therefore has plot armour/can't die). Stellan Skarsgård (who I like in some films, but not others) wasn't overly likable here either. Much better were the characters of Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt, who it was fun to notice in this movie after having seen him years later in Seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series Bron/Broen aka The Bridge). His character shares quite a memorably tense scene with Langdon at one point and Lindhardt ensures that his character makes an impact despite limited screentime.

This movie has a sense of humour that the first film didn't, but it's certainly not a laugh riot either, as there are several instances of gruesomeness, thus making it a far more intense film than the first. Hans Zimmer's score helps sell the suspense. The FX used in this movie illustrate the way CGI *should* be used (to help *add* to the film, rather than distract from it). The climax of the movie isn't quite what you might be expecting, as there's more to the story than first appears, and so long as you don't have a problem with reading subtitles, you should enjoy this film. Angels & Demons doesn't take itself too seriously (which is a plus, given the far-fetched circumstances) and is never dull. Apart from finally finding out just what exactly ""anti-matter"" is, the other thing I learned from this film was that being a Symbologist wouldn't be so bad a job, especially when you get to hang with a beautiful enigmatic Italian scientist.

79,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"While ""Angels & Demons"" is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.

From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, ""Angels"" is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of ""Da Vinci,"" especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.

Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to ""Angels & Demons,"" the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.

Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece.",Poor,angels demons means great film least manages consistently solid places head tails sorry predecessor mildly creepy opening mildly exciting finish angels fairly effective thriller plot bears quite similarities da vinci especially concerning supporting characters introduce strong device present first film stop robert langdon journey rome works excellent director howard seems scenes good feel eerie suspense gruesome reveals furthermore plot takes whole new direction lasts fitting slightly underwhelming climax thusly plot proceeds first frame last following part footsteps professor langdon played pretentiously yet tom hanks seems harvard professor one must bitterly sarcastic everyone deliver dragging monologues history long overstay welcome fact according angels demons said camerlengos ewan mcgregor plays film camerlengo convincingly pouring endless dull speeches nature faith mankind fault case lies wholly hands screenplay strangely enough however screenplay gives words vittoria vetra apparent female lead played inoffensively zuret stellan skarsgard armin fortunately fare better roles despite shortcomings areas cast delivers whole leading one wonder film better real culprit twist worthy dan brown novel screenplay movie drags minutes matching inspired thrill monologue piece unnecessary historical jargon beautiful shots beat bad pacing case fact forty minutes film could scraped away great effect sadly said forty minutes cut film bad masterpiece,True
80,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,5.0,"I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.

There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.

Although they did film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.

This movie should be received better by the critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie.",Average,premier movie last night rome expert book however great deal changes book movie pacing movie much faster davinci code many things trimmed otherwise would hour movie many things also changed give movie fast pace think matters feel movie works well hanks brown company things book would appear implausible movie form giving spoilers except say ending movie handled slightly different way leonardo vetra found also different see movie might interested reading book get full details story minor details also cut movie although film rome recreate interior shots since went walking tour rome day movie say interior sites authentic look feel kohler movie much shown cern hanks good job interesting scenes involving vatican archives course access area sure anyone actually knows vatican archives look like eyelet zurer break movie victoria vetra good job eye candy hanks movie received better critics public never know ron howard mentioned several times interviews saw cast movie movie,True
81,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"The Da Vinci Code movie was received with a mixture of enthusiasm and disappointment when it first arrived. The fans of the book couldn't wait for it, the Catholic church were going mad about it being released, and the average person was being shepherded to see a movie that they just wanted to know what all the media attention was about. I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit I was looking forward to it. I loved the book and wanted to see a great adaptation. I admit I enjoyed the movie, though a lot really didn't, but I will admit its slow moving, a bit tedious and way, way too faithful to the book. However I had read Dan Brown's other Langdon novel before Da Vinci Code, and I always found Angels and Demons the far superior story. And so here is the inevitable adaptation, and much like the books I prefer Angels and Demons. Demons is a fast paced, beautifully shot and brilliantly acted piece of popcorn entertainment. Yes it has its flaws, the story is still a bit all over the place, and various changes from the novel are not very welcome in my eyes. But for the most part this is a piece of superior entertainment, and after the disaster of Wolverine it is nice to see a sequel with a bit of thought behind it.

So onto the acting. First off is Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. First things first, the hair has been improved, I know that was a huge distraction for a lot of people in its predecessor. Hanks is pretty good here, I'm not going to lie and say he's incredible, as sadly Langdon isn't the greatest character ever. His motivations are vague at best. Still for the material he is given he makes the most of it. Ewan McGregor gets a great role in this movie, he was always the character that intrigued me most in the novel and McGregor does him justice. I won't spoil about him, but you understand after the halfway mark why such a famous actor was cast in the seemingly unimportant role. Ayelet Zurer does a great job as Vittoria Vetra, but the lack of screen time she gets in comparison to how much she is in the book really did frustrate me. Stellan Skarsgård is a bit wasted and I'm not too sure why he signed on for it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl is my personal favourite, have never really encountered the actor before, but his performance definitely is a highlight.

The key to Angels and Demons superiority is in the pacing. Da Vinci Code had very sluggish moments and too many endings for its own good. Here the movie is set over a night, and it works all the better for it. The plot zips along, and all the talky dialogue is usually done while driving or running to the next location to prevent a murder. The murders themselves are shot superbly, although the Air murder is nowhere near as gory as depicted in the novel. The Fire and Water murders are superb though. I liked the execution of the twist for the most part, and I don't think it was as blatantly obvious as I feared, considering it completely threw me when I read the book. The helicopter bit from the novel however is still ludicrous, and the whole antimatter scenario is a OTT for its own good. But these are the flaws of the novel, and at least the ridiculous divine intervention garbage has been scrapped.

Overall Angels and Demons is a fun thrill ride for the summer. Its a superior movie to Da Vinci Code, and I just hope The Lost Symbol (the upcoming Dan Brown novel) is good enough to warrant Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to sign on for yet another one.",Good,da vinci code movie received mixture enthusiasm disappointment first arrived fans book could wait catholic church going mad released average person shepherded see movie wanted know media attention first put hands admit looking forward loved book wanted see great adaptation admit enjoyed movie though lot really admit slow moving bit tedious way way faithful book however read dan brown langdon novel da vinci code always found angels demons far superior story inevitable adaptation much like books prefer angels demons demons fast paced beautifully shot brilliantly acted piece popcorn entertainment yes flaws story still bit place various changes novel welcome eyes part piece superior entertainment disaster wolverine nice see sequel bit thought behind onto acting first tom hanks robert langdon first things first hair improved know huge distraction lot people predecessor hanks pretty good going lie say incredible sadly langdon greatest character ever motivations vague best still material given makes ewan mcgregor gets great role movie always character intrigued novel mcgregor justice wo spoil understand halfway mark famous actor cast seemingly unimportant role ayelet zurer great job vittoria vetra lack screen time gets comparison much book really frustrate stellan skarsgård bit wasted sure signed armin personal favourite never really encountered actor performance definitely highlight key angels demons superiority pacing da vinci code sluggish moments many endings good movie set night works better plot zips along talky dialogue usually done driving running next location prevent murder murders shot superbly although air murder nowhere near gory depicted novel fire water murders superb though liked execution twist part think blatantly obvious feared considering completely threw read book helicopter bit novel however still ludicrous whole antimatter scenario ott good flaws novel least ridiculous divine intervention garbage scrapped overall angels demons fun thrill ride summer superior movie da vinci code hope lost symbol upcoming dan brown novel good enough warrant ron howard tom hanks sign yet another one,True
82,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.

Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a ""wait, it's at the chapel"" or ""Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!"" or ""No, that's not it, it's in the sewer"" or ""Wait, it's in my hat!""

It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.

Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was ""message"" like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero.",Average,angels demons follows heels da vinci code movie something really excited either way case macguffin leading characters silly adventure yes make mistake silliness disguised pompous seriousness jesus christ virgin mary fallacy well cube blow vatican city macguffin used way hitchcock clever meant used ideal science religion illuminatti war catholic church going use piece science blah blah whatever put mildly macguffin like would fine use characters story transparent go much focus review something simple angels demons exciting thriller drama twists turns happen rapidly much exposition swear screenwriters trying law order indeed would even blame dan brown dull jerkiness plot read book assume original text might fun way airplane paperback books move along pieces food thought also indeed consensus angels demons better book da vinci code even less controversial cinema something else every five minutes get wait chapel wait church give map sewer wait hat constant string gotchas guided suspenseful hand slick hollywood filmmaker ron howard made good movies day beautiful mind even star tom hanks apollo slightly element frankly hacks way thicket plot points explanation occasional moments striking hanks knocking one glass windows ever hard break losing oxygen vatican archives ultimately really get dan brown may wanted see sense looking religion catholicism seeing hypocrisies underneath science rules secretly would bad thing let people see science academia rules superstitions lasted millenia long ultimately already leaving mind part happened message like really compelling another rickety blockbuster machine really please hardcore fans book looking tom hanks superhero,True
83,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.

The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.

And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.

Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.

The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.

Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD.

84,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"My Take: While it's not as detailed as the novel, A&D maintains a fast pace and a thrilling build-up, improving upon its predecessor.

I haven't read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before seeing Ron Howard's movie adaptation, however I did read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS prior to Howard's big-screen take on the 2nd (but in the chronology of the novels, the 1st) Robert Langdon saga. I managed to read halfway through before deciding to go see the movie and avoid being disappointed that it wouldn't be half as good as its source. And sure enough, the movie is not as detailed and complex as the novel, already abridging half the novel into its first hour. But that, I guess, is rightfully so. While it does leave a few interesting points dangling, ANGELS & DEMONS is a first-rate thrilling piece of entertainment. Whether or not it has a rushed narrative, the fast pace still keeps the story moving and the novel's necessary bits of excitement don't disappoint on screen.

Tom Hanks is back, this time with a much nicer hairdo, as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned by the Vatican Police when a crisis is currently being held in the Holy See during the election of a new Pope. My, have the tables turned! Even after ""exposing"" the greatest Catholic cover-up in THE DA VINCI CODE, the Catholic church now runs to him for help. What irony! Anyway, the threat is the Illuminati, a sacrilegious society once devoted to proving that science, not religion, makes the world go round, resurrecting after hundreds of years to exact vengeance. They have already set an explosive device within its walls and is set to explode at midnight. That little McGuffin is the Antimatter, the exact opposite of our own matter, stolen from CERN in Geneva. Instead of being used as a superior power source at it is intended to be, it's now being used as a sort of bomb that will reduce the Holy See into rubble. Secondly, the four possible candidates for being the next Pope (the Preferiti) have been kidnapped and is set to be killed within four churches in Rome. Which ones? Only Prof. Langdon knows for sure, once again configuring a series of clues that will lead them to ""The Path of Illumination"", the Illuminati's hideout, and the possible location of that precious antimatter. With a little help from the tenacious and inquisitive Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer of MUNICH), they accompany the Vatican Swiss Guard across the streets of Rome as Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch ticks urgently.

I can smirk at a lot of things missing from the pages to film reels, but the film gives me very little time for that. Mr. Howard rightfully keeps the pace efficient and gripping, giving us little time to rest easy as even we feel the urgency of the hour. Though usually convicted of being miscast, Hanks makes a mostly apt Langdon (not so much of an action hero, but more of a thinker). Zurer seemingly lacks the greater spunk of the novels depiction of Vittoria, but still gives the role a fine spin. Although, it is quite a waste that the intimate relationship between Langdon and Vittoria are rarely given any depth. Ewen McGregor would have been a total miscast in the role of the Camerlengo, but he makes a dignified man-with-the-robe.

With the expense of deeper character development and more detailed clarification of the events, A&D succeeds at being first-rate, fast-paced entertainment, something that Howard's previous Brown opus, THE DA VINCI CODE, sorrily missed. I liked THE DA VINCI CODE, but even I must agree that the thrills and excitement are burdened by some of its self-indulgence. ANGELS & DEMONS rightfully makes up for that.

If you are searching for profundity it's not going to give you anything.

The score by the omnipresent Hans Zimmer is great and builds on the Da Vinci Code well, the editing and cgi work well and ensure that you feel that you are in the Vatican even when they couldn't shoot there. I shouldn't have liked it quite as much but like a big chocolate bar and just DID.

The Da Vinci code had more history and more facts to play with, A&D is more fiction from the get go. I liked how in the Davinci Code aspects of the storyline were re-enacted such as the Knights Templar and Isaac Newton's funeral. A&D uses no reenactments.

It was a good thriller, really, and I enjoyed every minute, but it just wasn't as good as the Davinci code in my opinion. It would help if you have been to Rome, are familiar with Italian art and architecture (from the late Roman period to the late Renaissance will suffice), and it wouldn't hurt if you were Catholic as well...

Otherwise, I have to say that for 50ish, Tom Hanks has a pretty good bod, and his sidekick is the spitting image of Nigela Lawson - I kept expecting her to look into the camera and describe what she wanted for lunch in sensuous adjectives.

This is what thrillers should be! The pacing is quick, leaving no time for breath at all. There is always a sense of urgency in the air as everyone has to race against time, making the plot very thrilling.

The ending is amazing. Just as I thought the film was ending, there was a twist, and another. Who would have predicted the ending? ""Angels & Demons"" excels in delivering two hours of pure intellectual adrenaline. I can safely say it is much better than ""The Da Vinci Code"". ""Angels & Demons"" is one of the best thrillers I have seen in years.

88,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"Absolute bore fest. I nearly fell asleep, it was that boring. I thought The Da Vinci Code was alright and although fairly average, I would consider watching that again. This one, however, wasn't for me. It started off slow and didn't improve from there. It was very snail-paced, but I saw it through to the end.

I can't fault the acting or the cinematography, but it lacked action and that spark. It was the same director, so I don't get it? It failed to keep your interest as much as the first movie. I have only watched this once, and Occasionally, it maybe needs to be given the benefit of the doubt because perhaps you weren't in the right frame of mind etc.

I almost have to watch this one again if I return to The Da Vinci Code in the future, as they go hand in hand. Hopefully, I may have a fresh outlook on it, but I highly doubt it.

89,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"I can see why the Vatican didn't have any objections to this film. The reason is because it was so badly adapted and poorly put together that they knew it would get bad reviews on its own. The church didn't need to interfere in this one. I guess Dan Brown really needed the money. Otherwise I can't see how anyone would allow their work to be bastardized this badly.

In the closing credits, it says something to the effect of ""based on the adaption of."" What it should have said was ""based on the very loose, poor adaptation and the location is the only thing we have in common of."" The movie was so dissimilar to the novel in storyline and characters that I wondered if I was in the wrong theater. Clearly the directors took massive amounts of liberty in shooting the film. I fully recognize that you cannot adapt a Dan Brown novel 100% into a 2 hour movie (like Santa delivering all of the presents in one night) but the liberties they took went too far and strayed very far from the book. Ewan Mcgregor who is a fine actor was not the right person for the role of Carmalengo. Vittoria Vetra was not fully developed and a very critical element was left out of the movie. I think what annoyed me the most about the movie is the four preferiti plot line. In the attempt to be politically correct and story-wise expedient, they fail tremendously to deliver on this story-line.

If I didn't read the novel ahead of time, I probably would have been kinder in my score but since I did, I really tried to like the movie and was excited for its release. It was just disappointing. The only liberty which I approved of was changing the assassin from being a Muslim to a non-Muslim. There seems to be too many movies where Muslims are evil and this change does not affect the movie at all.

I generally judge a movie based on whether I would pay full price, matinée price, Netflix/video rental or don't bother at all.

'Angels and Demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.

The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.

The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.

The actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors, and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.

Unfortunately, he's a major presence in ANGELS & DEMONS, Ron Howard's follow-up to his DA VINCI CODE. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon, and this is based on another Dan Brown novel.

The good news is that it's better than the awful DA VINCI CODE, but then it couldn't exactly be worse. ANGELS & DEMONS has pace in the first hour and style in places, and some interesting snippets of historical information thrown into the mix, although it's still saddled with the same problems as its predecessor; namely, that the clever-clever plot which tries to be so intricate all the way through actually turns out to be incredibly simplistic and naive come the end. It's also incredibly overlong, and dull in places.

It's admirably vicious for a family film, with all manner of nasty deaths that in some ways recall the SAW franchise, a clear inspiration here. Tom Hanks is also better, more relaxed and at the same time more believable in his role. However, the shonky script wastes the talents of the likes of Stellan Skarsgard and the other cast members like Armin Mueller-Stahl, and it gets increasingly ludicrous as it goes on, reaching a nadir with the ridiculously cheesy effects of the helicopter finale.

Let me ask you , once you've been to see the film.....did you think that you needed all the symbolism explained?

As Dr Mark Kermode said in his review on BBC Radio, the problem with the ""Da Vinci Code""...was that they stood around and pointed at something, explained it and then rushed to the next place.....Angels and Demons has improved.....now they do the explanations whilst they are running to the next set piece - ""result""!

On a separate note, if you want to play a little game in the movie....try to work out what area of the world Ewan Magregor is supposed to have come from ......Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins comes to mind....

And if you don't laugh out loud about ten minutes from the end when Hans Zimmer's music tries to capture the solemnity of the moment amidst the funniest slapstick since Laurel and Hardy.....then you take yourself and this movie far too seriously....!

The biggest problem for me is that I believe cinema audiences are not fools...... we do not need exposition every thirty seconds.....because let's face it...if you've read the book you know most of the stuff...and if you haven't read the book...then you might have been tempted to read the book to get the detail....(I know there will be some for whom such a movie would confirm that Hollywood dumbs down everything)...but in this film they could have used the symbolism that is the source of the film to make a much more cinematically intelligent movie e.g. ""Light"" as a symbol for enlightenment and yet in contradiction Lucifer the ""light giver"".....or make more of the conflict between ""science"" and the ""church"" which is the cornerstone of the film's plot or illuminate the contradictions between angels and demons.

But then maybe I am wrong, maybe we the audience are stupid and if we go to a movie based on a best seller...we can't expect anything else but that the accountants and the number crunchers will have told Ron Howard what they want the film to ""do""....in all senses, artistically and financially.....

For me opportunity lost to make a great intelligent movie that would have departed no more from the book than the film we have before us.

97,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.

So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.

Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.

The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.

Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.

Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid.

I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.

Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.

A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.

Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.

I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think.

101,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.

The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.

Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.

Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.

This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.

The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.

This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.

Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.

It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.

Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible.

102,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"Adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, a follow-up to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code"", has so much plot exposition, location trotting, CGI effects and elaborate camera set-ups in the first thirty minutes, one is apt to be blown away or perhaps toppled over by the breathless racing about. Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled.

103,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.

With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.

Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.

Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.

The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.

Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.

If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",Good,da vinci code introduced us robert langdon knack solving puzzles angels demons ups ante providing huge puzzle hour limit cast award winning actors ron howard good job directing story easy follow even easier accept da vinci code threw many angles short time quick bathroom break would leave bit confused return feel angels demons plot action kept interest level peaked throughout cardinal strauss armin easily favorite character movie portrayal elitist yet misunderstood rank catholic church good combined victim treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor find choosing sides immediately upon introduction great amount tom hanks time film focuses story character development well enough introduction first movie unfortunately found ayelet zurer character vittoria vetra unnecessary femme assistant quest since lines bit limited seemed much like afterthought play key role beginning things soon fades background langdon familiar necessary partner plot one organizations catholic church wronged past quite sought revenge artistic manner men church kidnapped set executed specific times ultimate end church happen robert landon brought help decipher clues teams beautiful vittoria vetra scientist witnessed colleague die hands church enemy music staying relevant cinematography beautiful could chime menial things makes angels demons absolutely work conclusion far one amazingly surprising endings seen movie impressed hit like anyone else appreciate great movie wraps quite tight drops pretty bow needless say left theater pleased movie entirety religious unsure movie offend catholic principles say davinci code painted catholicism shady group sadists angels demons paints much lighter brush church shown collective good men made suffer sins evil misguided men wore colors even infiltrated modern ranks,True

The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.

You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. If you haven't read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting.

You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.

But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.

So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.

Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.

Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.

What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable.

108,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.

Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead.

Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors).

The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.

Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?).

109,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.

The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.

The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.

AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.

The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.

It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.

110,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!

Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.

As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.

I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!

Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.

111,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.

Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.

Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance.

The symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and the scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), who had her powerful and dangerous prototype of antimatter research stolen, are invited by the Vatican police to help them in their investigation. They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.

The novel and bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I have read. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of that complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable and the movie frustrated my expectations.

113,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.

Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.

Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.

The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",Average,doubt ron howard great hero movie proved truly professional skilled director perfectly understood nature dan brown novel aim production thus result well made well performed product certainly top movie dan brown wrote impressive thriller made action suspense paradoxical surprising twists aim selling ron howard spares effort succeeds rendering thrilling engaging story based well consolidated narrative outline find trustworthy hero robert langdon capable unraveling every mysterious sign leading us shocking finale everything course sounds excessive crescendo excess limit ridiculous worth underlining typical capability hollywood great productions take job seriously make good product nothing viewer conscious real nature displayed counts final result aesthetically good entertaining movie indeed evidently movie like book represents threat unbreakable solidness roman catholic church even less faith real faithful people fears reluctance clerical authorities movie distributed sounded little excessive indeed end even romano gave favourable review even movie least offers new interesting perspective ancient let admit quite probably fashion dichotomy science religion pretext build strong till end entertaining story still able attract millions viewers world remaining nonsense forgivable whole cast prove good performances tom hanks certainty beginning however opinion ewan macgregor camerlengo interesting character one langdon interesting exchange faith actors even pierfrancesco favino contribute enthralling atmosphere story,True

So with that said, this probably wasn't one of the most exciting movies I've seen this year though it did get better as the movie went on. Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go. Ron Howard provides his own compelling direction to the fore though, like I said, it didn't completely jell for me.

116,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by ""Angels & Demons"", the follow-up to the ludicruous ""The Da Vinci Code"", where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.

Actually a prequel of ""The Da Vinci Code"" novel, the events in ""Angels & Demons"" is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.

Lecturing and pontificating, ""Angels & Demons""' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist.

117,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"It is the mark of a truly talented director to smoothly flow between Oscar nominated dramas and big budget summer blockbusters, as is it to take the criticisms of a previous franchise instalment and buff and polish the sequel into a superior, smoother film. That is precisely what director Ron Howard does with the second Dan Brown adaptation Angels & Demons, cleverly folding what would be bloated subplots and somewhat ridiculous chapters into a more streamline narrative; mostly loyal but cleverly translated.

Howard re-unites with Tom Hanks, who again stars as symbologist Robert Langdon. A prequel to the mega-hit The Da Vinci code on paper but interpreted as a sequel on film Angels & Demons progresses more quickly, talks less, features some solid supporting performances and has a spectacular final, effects-driven climax. Alas, even with most of the right moves and even more genuine intention Howard's film is simply not as good as the book, neither in cleverness or pacing. In the novel, Langdon's revelations are able to be drawn out and incorporate far more clues and twists and turns. Moreover, the much loved science vs. religion dispute is far better utilized as are the dark history of Rome and the origins and intentions of the secret society of the Illuminati which is the true spine of the story.

Scooped up by the Vatican late one evening and jetted off to The Vatican, Robert Langdon again finds himself in danger adjacent to history, religion and ancient lore. Following the death of The Pope, and the subsequent induction of the next, an old threat rears its head once again. The ancient society of The Illuminati has come for revenge after centuries of suppression and secret annihilation at the hands of the church. Marring the ancient tradition of papal election is the kidnapping of the four preferiti (the cardinals most favoured to success the late Pope) and a bomb threat which could boast a devastating end to Vatican City. Langdon follows the ancient clues of the Illuminati along with a lovely scientist (Ayelet Zurer) who created the bomb which now threatens them all, Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Camerlengo McKenna (an excellent Ewan McGregor) the Pope's temporary successor and adopted son. Time runs out as Langdon and his team race to recover the four Cardinals held by a deadly Illuminati assassin (who if I may say is completely badass) and ultimately the bomb.

Aside from the understandable nuances lost in the adaptation, a number of climatic elements were dropped that I found somewhat disappointing. I will not reveal them here, but if you are a fan you will pick them out easily. Thankfully though this will serve as no detriment to those not experienced with the Dan Brown's works and should still unfold as a satisfying finale. Technically, Angels & Demons is impeccable as are the shots of Rome and The Vatican. Howard's choice to assemble an international cast and not concern himself with cramming countless A list stars into the production is admirable and ultimately an asset. Hanks is adequate but is overshadowed by McGregor but helps the cast round out nicely in the end. This will not likely be the last we will see of Robert Langdon and here is hoping Howard et al can one-up themselves again and cap off an entertaining, if uneven, mystery trilogy.

118,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.

The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter.

The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way.

The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets.

However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost).

While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder.

A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.

119,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,2.0,"Angels & Demons (2009) is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling mystery-thriller novel of the same title hat is based on the dark secrets in the history of Catholicism and the fight of the Catholic Church against the underground societies and their influence. There is a lot to like in the new film: the pace is very fast and appropriately so, the views of Rome and its historical and art treasures are gorgeous, as well as the look into Vatican chambers, passages, and catacombs. The lecture which was given by Ewan McGregor (who looked very appealing as a young priest) about history of struggle between Catholic Church and mysterious powerful secret society of ""Illuminati"" over the Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years, or the religion against the science, was quite insightful and illuminating. Tom Hanks who reprised the role of the Harvard Professor Robert Langdon with the obvious gift for solving tricky puzzles and finding the meaning of secret symbols was once again on hand to provide the solution for yet another Catholic Church serious crisis that threatens the very existence of Vatican City and the college of cardinals who gathered from all over the world to elect the new Pope . I should admit that I liked Hanks in this movie much better than in the first adaptation of Dan Brown's historic- religious mystery ""Da Vinci Code"". I also found Angels & Demons much more fun to watch, maybe because in the new film, its creators concentrate on the crime/mystery/thriller/action elements and did not try to add much drama to it.

120,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"A few years ago there was The Davinci Code. In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.

All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.

Although Brown wrote ""Angels & Demons"" first, the film version represents this story, which is sympathetic to the Catholic Church, as following ""The Da Vinci Code"" which was seen as hostile to the Church. Whatever the difference in stance towards Catholicism, Brown's work is always terribly formulaic: a twisting plot set over a matter of hours, lots of symbols and signs, considerable running, much desecration of the flesh, the counterbalancing of religion and science, minimal characterisation, and changing perception of key characters. This time it's all cardinals, cathedrals, crypts and catacombs plus a camerlengo scattered over central Rome and the Vatican.

Again Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist does his best with a wooden script (but a better haircut) - at least ""Angels & Demons"" is less wordy than ""The Da Vinci Code"". Again there is only one female character - this time Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer). Scottish Ewan McGregor (who struggles to affect a Northern Irish accent), German Armin Mueller-Stahl and Swedish Stellan Skarsgård each play Vatican officials who may be an angel or a demon. It's hard to work out which is the greatest threat: the Illuminati, an anti-matter bomb or the implausibilities of the plot. Papal bull or curate's egg? - you decide.

123,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Can Robert Langdon save the Catholic Church and prevent Vatican City from destruction? The race is on as Ron Howard's multi-million dollar blockbuster sequel finally hits the big screen. We last saw Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) 3 years ago, when he uncovered the truth behind a secret society. Now, he's called on once again. This time the stakes are higher, the case is deadlier and the mystery is unlike anything he's witnessed. Here, he's called to Rome to study a mysterious death of one of the 4 cardinals. Little does he know that he's tangled up in a war between the Catholic Church and a Secret Society known as the Illuminati (the enemy to the Catholic Church.) He soon learns that a member of Illuminati has kidnapped 3 other cardinals, threatening to kill one an hour and seizing to destroy Vatican City when the conclave begins. There on he goes on the hunt with a brilliant Scientist (Ayelet Zurer) followed by mysterious twists, turns and deaths headed their way. The only question is can they stop the attack in time? Ron Howard's Angels and Demons is better than his first outing (Da Vinci Code) in every single way possible. It's better in terms of quality, story, and entertainment. The suspense started very early (unlike the slow moving Da Vinci Code) and has enough action and great shots of the Vatican to keep you in your seat for at least 2 hours. Think of it as National Treasure meets 24 in Rome. Despite its potential, it also does has some flaws. It's still preachy, preposterous, and somewhat predictable. Did I mention it also felt like it went on for longer than it needed to be? If you're an open minded person, and often use ""That can never happen"" then you then you may want to take this one off your alley.

124,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"I'd heard the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code movie, never read the book, never saw it at the theatre, eventually hired it on DVD (remember hiring DVDs?) and...was pretty bored by it. I've come around to not-minding it on subsequent viewings when it's been repeated numerous times on TV, but I much prefer this second film. I saw this one at the theatre, hadn't read the book...which I think helped me enjoy the movie, as I felt this one was the most interesting/had the best pacing and actually felt like a proper movie mystery/thriller. It's my favourite of the trilogy and the one I've rewatched the most. I think, as a whole, Angels & Demons is just a better-told film. It isn't slow-paced/plodding along with a drawn-out conclusion like The Da Vinci Code was. Although Ron Howard directed all three films in the trilogy, *this* is the one that kept me interested throughout (even during the 'slower' moments). Tom Hanks seems more at ease in his role as Robert Langdon this time around; his likeability ensuring the audience *cares* what happens to him, and his delivery of exposition (of which there is quite a lot) thankfully didn't ever really bore me. I never saw what the big deal was about his hair in the first film, but any who feared that his 'do would be the 'demon' from the title of this film needn't fear, as it's shorter now.

The biggest improvement with this film over its predecessor, I thought, was Langdon's female partner he's paired with this time around. As the intelligent and beautiful Vittoria Vetra (who I found much more interesting than Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu from the first film), Ayelet Zurer is more of an 'equal' to Hanks's Langdon. They make quite the team, and Vittoria proves that she can indeed keep up with him (which is especially impressive since, as I heard Tom Hanks himself say during a radio interview when the film was being released, 'like every beautiful particle physicist...she wears Manolo Blahniks whilst running on cobblestone'). It's a bit of a shame, however, that unlike the beginning and end of the film, the middle is spent with her character and Langdon separated. After enjoying the two of them onscreen together so much at the start of the movie, I was disappointed they split up for what felt like quite a long period of time midway through. The actors have a nice chemistry, there's an ease/comfortableness between them, and I was amused during one scene that showed Vittoria's much more blunt/direct approach to getting what they needed as quickly as possible and Langdon's reaction to it. The two of them also obviously got a lot of exercise during filming, given all the running around that's involved.

Ewan McGregor is another actor who brings an instant likeability to his character, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, and I think the movie benefited from this considering the direction in which the film goes with him. It's important we *like* him. McGregor really owned the last third of the film with his performance, I felt. While there are other somewhat important characters in the movie, I felt these main three were the most memorable. Unfortunately, I wasn't as interested in this movie's bad guy; The Assassin (because *all* of these movies HAVE to have one of those, apparently). Nikolaj Lie Kaas wasn't as intriguing a villain as Paul Bettany's albino monk, Silas, was in the first film (though at least this assassin gives a *reason* for not killing Langdon, despite having several chances to do so, rather than it just being because he's the lead and therefore has plot armour/can't die). Stellan Skarsgård (who I like in some films, but not others) wasn't overly likable here either. Much better were the characters of Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt, who it was fun to notice in this movie after having seen him years later in Seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series Bron/Broen aka The Bridge). His character shares quite a memorably tense scene with Langdon at one point and Lindhardt ensures that his character makes an impact despite limited screentime.

This movie has a sense of humour that the first film didn't, but it's certainly not a laugh riot either, as there are several instances of gruesomeness, thus making it a far more intense film than the first. Hans Zimmer's score helps sell the suspense. The FX used in this movie illustrate the way CGI *should* be used (to help *add* to the film, rather than distract from it). The climax of the movie isn't quite what you might be expecting, as there's more to the story than first appears, and so long as you don't have a problem with reading subtitles, you should enjoy this film. Angels & Demons doesn't take itself too seriously (which is a plus, given the far-fetched circumstances) and is never dull. Apart from finally finding out just what exactly ""anti-matter"" is, the other thing I learned from this film was that being a Symbologist wouldn't be so bad a job, especially when you get to hang with a beautiful enigmatic Italian scientist.

125,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"While ""Angels & Demons"" is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.

From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, ""Angels"" is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of ""Da Vinci,"" especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.

Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to ""Angels & Demons,"" the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.

Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece.",Poor,angels demons means great film least manages consistently solid places head tails sorry predecessor mildly creepy opening mildly exciting finish angels fairly effective thriller plot bears quite similarities da vinci especially concerning supporting characters introduce strong device present first film stop robert langdon journey rome works excellent director howard seems scenes good feel eerie suspense gruesome reveals furthermore plot takes whole new direction lasts fitting slightly underwhelming climax thusly plot proceeds first frame last following part footsteps professor langdon played pretentiously yet tom hanks seems harvard professor one must bitterly sarcastic everyone deliver dragging monologues history long overstay welcome fact according angels demons said camerlengos ewan mcgregor plays film camerlengo convincingly pouring endless dull speeches nature faith mankind fault case lies wholly hands screenplay strangely enough however screenplay gives words vittoria vetra apparent female lead played inoffensively zuret stellan skarsgard armin fortunately fare better roles despite shortcomings areas cast delivers whole leading one wonder film better real culprit twist worthy dan brown novel screenplay movie drags minutes matching inspired thrill monologue piece unnecessary historical jargon beautiful shots beat bad pacing case fact forty minutes film could scraped away great effect sadly said forty minutes cut film bad masterpiece,True
126,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,5.0,"I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.

There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.

Although they did film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.

This movie should be received better by the critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie.",Average,premier movie last night rome expert book however great deal changes book movie pacing movie much faster davinci code many things trimmed otherwise would hour movie many things also changed give movie fast pace think matters feel movie works well hanks brown company things book would appear implausible movie form giving spoilers except say ending movie handled slightly different way leonardo vetra found also different see movie might interested reading book get full details story minor details also cut movie although film rome recreate interior shots since went walking tour rome day movie say interior sites authentic look feel kohler movie much shown cern hanks good job interesting scenes involving vatican archives course access area sure anyone actually knows vatican archives look like eyelet zurer break movie victoria vetra good job eye candy hanks movie received better critics public never know ron howard mentioned several times interviews saw cast movie movie,True
127,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"The Da Vinci Code movie was received with a mixture of enthusiasm and disappointment when it first arrived. The fans of the book couldn't wait for it, the Catholic church were going mad about it being released, and the average person was being shepherded to see a movie that they just wanted to know what all the media attention was about. I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit I was looking forward to it. I loved the book and wanted to see a great adaptation. I admit I enjoyed the movie, though a lot really didn't, but I will admit its slow moving, a bit tedious and way, way too faithful to the book. However I had read Dan Brown's other Langdon novel before Da Vinci Code, and I always found Angels and Demons the far superior story. And so here is the inevitable adaptation, and much like the books I prefer Angels and Demons. Demons is a fast paced, beautifully shot and brilliantly acted piece of popcorn entertainment. Yes it has its flaws, the story is still a bit all over the place, and various changes from the novel are not very welcome in my eyes. But for the most part this is a piece of superior entertainment, and after the disaster of Wolverine it is nice to see a sequel with a bit of thought behind it.

So onto the acting. First off is Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. First things first, the hair has been improved, I know that was a huge distraction for a lot of people in its predecessor. Hanks is pretty good here, I'm not going to lie and say he's incredible, as sadly Langdon isn't the greatest character ever. His motivations are vague at best. Still for the material he is given he makes the most of it. Ewan McGregor gets a great role in this movie, he was always the character that intrigued me most in the novel and McGregor does him justice. I won't spoil about him, but you understand after the halfway mark why such a famous actor was cast in the seemingly unimportant role. Ayelet Zurer does a great job as Vittoria Vetra, but the lack of screen time she gets in comparison to how much she is in the book really did frustrate me. Stellan Skarsgård is a bit wasted and I'm not too sure why he signed on for it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl is my personal favourite, have never really encountered the actor before, but his performance definitely is a highlight.

The key to Angels and Demons superiority is in the pacing. Da Vinci Code had very sluggish moments and too many endings for its own good. Here the movie is set over a night, and it works all the better for it. The plot zips along, and all the talky dialogue is usually done while driving or running to the next location to prevent a murder. The murders themselves are shot superbly, although the Air murder is nowhere near as gory as depicted in the novel. The Fire and Water murders are superb though. I liked the execution of the twist for the most part, and I don't think it was as blatantly obvious as I feared, considering it completely threw me when I read the book. The helicopter bit from the novel however is still ludicrous, and the whole antimatter scenario is a OTT for its own good. But these are the flaws of the novel, and at least the ridiculous divine intervention garbage has been scrapped.

Overall Angels and Demons is a fun thrill ride for the summer. Its a superior movie to Da Vinci Code, and I just hope The Lost Symbol (the upcoming Dan Brown novel) is good enough to warrant Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to sign on for yet another one.",Good,da vinci code movie received mixture enthusiasm disappointment first arrived fans book could wait catholic church going mad released average person shepherded see movie wanted know media attention first put hands admit looking forward loved book wanted see great adaptation admit enjoyed movie though lot really admit slow moving bit tedious way way faithful book however read dan brown langdon novel da vinci code always found angels demons far superior story inevitable adaptation much like books prefer angels demons demons fast paced beautifully shot brilliantly acted piece popcorn entertainment yes flaws story still bit place various changes novel welcome eyes part piece superior entertainment disaster wolverine nice see sequel bit thought behind onto acting first tom hanks robert langdon first things first hair improved know huge distraction lot people predecessor hanks pretty good going lie say incredible sadly langdon greatest character ever motivations vague best still material given makes ewan mcgregor gets great role movie always character intrigued novel mcgregor justice wo spoil understand halfway mark famous actor cast seemingly unimportant role ayelet zurer great job vittoria vetra lack screen time gets comparison much book really frustrate stellan skarsgård bit wasted sure signed armin personal favourite never really encountered actor performance definitely highlight key angels demons superiority pacing da vinci code sluggish moments many endings good movie set night works better plot zips along talky dialogue usually done driving running next location prevent murder murders shot superbly although air murder nowhere near gory depicted novel fire water murders superb though liked execution twist part think blatantly obvious feared considering completely threw read book helicopter bit novel however still ludicrous whole antimatter scenario ott good flaws novel least ridiculous divine intervention garbage scrapped overall angels demons fun thrill ride summer superior movie da vinci code hope lost symbol upcoming dan brown novel good enough warrant ron howard tom hanks sign yet another one,True
128,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.

Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a ""wait, it's at the chapel"" or ""Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!"" or ""No, that's not it, it's in the sewer"" or ""Wait, it's in my hat!""

It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.

Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was ""message"" like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero.",Average,angels demons follows heels da vinci code movie something really excited either way case macguffin leading characters silly adventure yes make mistake silliness disguised pompous seriousness jesus christ virgin mary fallacy well cube blow vatican city macguffin used way hitchcock clever meant used ideal science religion illuminatti war catholic church going use piece science blah blah whatever put mildly macguffin like would fine use characters story transparent go much focus review something simple angels demons exciting thriller drama twists turns happen rapidly much exposition swear screenwriters trying law order indeed would even blame dan brown dull jerkiness plot read book assume original text might fun way airplane paperback books move along pieces food thought also indeed consensus angels demons better book da vinci code even less controversial cinema something else every five minutes get wait chapel wait church give map sewer wait hat constant string gotchas guided suspenseful hand slick hollywood filmmaker ron howard made good movies day beautiful mind even star tom hanks apollo slightly element frankly hacks way thicket plot points explanation occasional moments striking hanks knocking one glass windows ever hard break losing oxygen vatican archives ultimately really get dan brown may wanted see sense looking religion catholicism seeing hypocrisies underneath science rules secretly would bad thing let people see science academia rules superstitions lasted millenia long ultimately already leaving mind part happened message like really compelling another rickety blockbuster machine really please hardcore fans book looking tom hanks superhero,True
129,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.

The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.

And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.

Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.

The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.

Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD.

130,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"My Take: While it's not as detailed as the novel, A&D maintains a fast pace and a thrilling build-up, improving upon its predecessor.

I haven't read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before seeing Ron Howard's movie adaptation, however I did read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS prior to Howard's big-screen take on the 2nd (but in the chronology of the novels, the 1st) Robert Langdon saga. I managed to read halfway through before deciding to go see the movie and avoid being disappointed that it wouldn't be half as good as its source. And sure enough, the movie is not as detailed and complex as the novel, already abridging half the novel into its first hour. But that, I guess, is rightfully so. While it does leave a few interesting points dangling, ANGELS & DEMONS is a first-rate thrilling piece of entertainment. Whether or not it has a rushed narrative, the fast pace still keeps the story moving and the novel's necessary bits of excitement don't disappoint on screen.

Tom Hanks is back, this time with a much nicer hairdo, as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned by the Vatican Police when a crisis is currently being held in the Holy See during the election of a new Pope. My, have the tables turned! Even after ""exposing"" the greatest Catholic cover-up in THE DA VINCI CODE, the Catholic church now runs to him for help. What irony! Anyway, the threat is the Illuminati, a sacrilegious society once devoted to proving that science, not religion, makes the world go round, resurrecting after hundreds of years to exact vengeance. They have already set an explosive device within its walls and is set to explode at midnight. That little McGuffin is the Antimatter, the exact opposite of our own matter, stolen from CERN in Geneva. Instead of being used as a superior power source at it is intended to be, it's now being used as a sort of bomb that will reduce the Holy See into rubble. Secondly, the four possible candidates for being the next Pope (the Preferiti) have been kidnapped and is set to be killed within four churches in Rome. Which ones? Only Prof. Langdon knows for sure, once again configuring a series of clues that will lead them to ""The Path of Illumination"", the Illuminati's hideout, and the possible location of that precious antimatter. With a little help from the tenacious and inquisitive Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer of MUNICH), they accompany the Vatican Swiss Guard across the streets of Rome as Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch ticks urgently.

I can smirk at a lot of things missing from the pages to film reels, but the film gives me very little time for that. Mr. Howard rightfully keeps the pace efficient and gripping, giving us little time to rest easy as even we feel the urgency of the hour. Though usually convicted of being miscast, Hanks makes a mostly apt Langdon (not so much of an action hero, but more of a thinker). Zurer seemingly lacks the greater spunk of the novels depiction of Vittoria, but still gives the role a fine spin. Although, it is quite a waste that the intimate relationship between Langdon and Vittoria are rarely given any depth. Ewen McGregor would have been a total miscast in the role of the Camerlengo, but he makes a dignified man-with-the-robe.

With the expense of deeper character development and more detailed clarification of the events, A&D succeeds at being first-rate, fast-paced entertainment, something that Howard's previous Brown opus, THE DA VINCI CODE, sorrily missed. I liked THE DA VINCI CODE, but even I must agree that the thrills and excitement are burdened by some of its self-indulgence. ANGELS & DEMONS rightfully makes up for that.

If you are searching for profundity it's not going to give you anything.

The score by the omnipresent Hans Zimmer is great and builds on the Da Vinci Code well, the editing and cgi work well and ensure that you feel that you are in the Vatican even when they couldn't shoot there. I shouldn't have liked it quite as much but like a big chocolate bar and just DID.

The Da Vinci code had more history and more facts to play with, A&D is more fiction from the get go. I liked how in the Davinci Code aspects of the storyline were re-enacted such as the Knights Templar and Isaac Newton's funeral. A&D uses no reenactments.

It was a good thriller, really, and I enjoyed every minute, but it just wasn't as good as the Davinci code in my opinion. It would help if you have been to Rome, are familiar with Italian art and architecture (from the late Roman period to the late Renaissance will suffice), and it wouldn't hurt if you were Catholic as well...

Otherwise, I have to say that for 50ish, Tom Hanks has a pretty good bod, and his sidekick is the spitting image of Nigela Lawson - I kept expecting her to look into the camera and describe what she wanted for lunch in sensuous adjectives.

There is always a sense of urgency in the air as everyone has to race against time, making the plot very thrilling.

The ending is amazing. Just as I thought the film was ending, there was a twist, and another. Who would have predicted the ending?

I thought The Da Vinci Code was alright and although fairly average, I would consider watching that again. This one, however, wasn't for me. It started off slow and didn't improve from there. It was very snail-paced, but I saw it through to the end.

I can't fault the acting or the cinematography, but it lacked action and that spark. It was the same director, so I don't get it? It failed to keep your interest as much as the first movie. I have only watched this once, and Occasionally, it maybe needs to be given the benefit of the doubt because perhaps you weren't in the right frame of mind etc.

I almost have to watch this one again if I return to The Da Vinci Code in the future, as they go hand in hand. Hopefully, I may have a fresh outlook on it, but I highly doubt it.

135,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"I can see why the Vatican didn't have any objections to this film. The reason is because it was so badly adapted and poorly put together that they knew it would get bad reviews on its own. The church didn't need to interfere in this one. I guess Dan Brown really needed the money. Otherwise I can't see how anyone would allow their work to be bastardized this badly.

In the closing credits, it says something to the effect of ""based on the adaption of."" What it should have said was ""based on the very loose, poor adaptation and the location is the only thing we have in common of."" The movie was so dissimilar to the novel in storyline and characters that I wondered if I was in the wrong theater. Clearly the directors took massive amounts of liberty in shooting the film. I fully recognize that you cannot adapt a Dan Brown novel 100% into a 2 hour movie (like Santa delivering all of the presents in one night) but the liberties they took went too far and strayed very far from the book. Ewan Mcgregor who is a fine actor was not the right person for the role of Carmalengo. Vittoria Vetra was not fully developed and a very critical element was left out of the movie. I think what annoyed me the most about the movie is the four preferiti plot line. In the attempt to be politically correct and story-wise expedient, they fail tremendously to deliver on this story-line.

If I didn't read the novel ahead of time, I probably would have been kinder in my score but since I did, I really tried to like the movie and was excited for its release. It was just disappointing. The only liberty which I approved of was changing the assassin from being a Muslim to a non-Muslim. There seems to be too many movies where Muslims are evil and this change does not affect the movie at all.

I generally judge a movie based on whether I would pay full price, matinée price, Netflix/video rental or don't bother at all.

I didn't like it much.

Way to overly complicated.

As well as being very very very very very talkie.

I was rather bored from the beginning. Some of the dialog is actually laughable.

Following the murder of a physicist, Father Silvano Bentivoglio, a symbolist, Robert Langdon, and a scientist, Vittoria Vetra, are on an adventure involving a secret brotherhood, the Illuminati.

Clues lead them all around the Vatican, including the four altars of science, Earth, Air, Fire and Water.

An assassin, working for the Illuminati, has captured four cardinals, and murders each, painfully.

137,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,10.0,"I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, I had no expectations.

'Angels and Demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.

The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.

The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.

The actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors, and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.

The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess, that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.",Good,neither read books seen first movie receiving passes preview show expectations demons muddled convoluted film lacking direction believability little character development never found caring plight protagonists reverse true interested seeing antagonists would succeed first half film almost exclusively focused illuminati film jumps location location little explanation reason expects viewer believe everybody movie ally first meet analytical mind realize highly improbable climax extremely cliché leaves asking happened wondering nobody considered points feels tacked unnecessary actors particularly believable roles mostly found difficult believe scientists professors men church would act manner without regard consequences actions events happen plausible slightest pace movie questionable characters jumping around tight schedule question protagonists manage get location location time every time pleasing part film cinematography found beautiful film watch mess found would worth paying view theatres,True

140,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,2.0,"Is anyone else increasingly tired of Ewan McGregor's trite mannerisms and being stuck with his own brand of non-acting in film after film? Unfortunately, he's a major presence in ANGELS & DEMONS, Ron Howard's follow-up to his DA VINCI CODE. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon, and this is based on another Dan Brown novel.

The good news is that it's better than the awful DA VINCI CODE, but then it couldn't exactly be worse. ANGELS & DEMONS has pace in the first hour and style in places, and some interesting snippets of historical information thrown into the mix, although it's still saddled with the same problems as its predecessor; namely, that the clever-clever plot which tries to be so intricate all the way through actually turns out to be incredibly simplistic and naive come the end. It's also incredibly overlong, and dull in places.

It's admirably vicious for a family film, with all manner of nasty deaths that in some ways recall the SAW franchise, a clear inspiration here. Tom Hanks is also better, more relaxed and at the same time more believable in his role. However, the shonky script wastes the talents of the likes of Stellan Skarsgard and the other cast members like Armin Mueller-Stahl, and it gets increasingly ludicrous as it goes on, reaching a nadir with the ridiculously cheesy effects of the helicopter finale.

Let me ask you , once you've been to see the film.....did you think that you needed all the symbolism explained?

As Dr Mark Kermode said in his review on BBC Radio, the problem with the ""Da Vinci Code""...was that they stood around and pointed at something, explained it and then rushed to the next place.....Angels and Demons has improved.....now they do the explanations whilst they are running to the next set piece - ""result""!

On a separate note, if you want to play a little game in the movie....try to work out what area of the world Ewan Magregor is supposed to have come from ......Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins comes to mind....

And if you don't laugh out loud about ten minutes from the end when Hans Zimmer's music tries to capture the solemnity of the moment amidst the funniest slapstick since Laurel and Hardy.....then you take yourself and this movie far too seriously....!

The biggest problem for me is that I believe cinema audiences are not fools...... we do not need exposition every thirty seconds.....because let's face it...if you've read the book you know most of the stuff...and if you haven't read the book...then you might have been tempted to read the book to get the detail....(I know there will be some for whom such a movie would confirm that Hollywood dumbs down everything)...but in this film they could have used the symbolism that is the source of the film to make a much more cinematically intelligent movie e.g. ""Light"" as a symbol for enlightenment and yet in contradiction Lucifer the ""light giver"".....or make more of the conflict between ""science"" and the ""church"" which is the cornerstone of the film's plot or illuminate the contradictions between angels and demons.

But then maybe I am wrong, maybe we the audience are stupid and if we go to a movie based on a best seller...we can't expect anything else but that the accountants and the number crunchers will have told Ron Howard what they want the film to ""do""....in all senses, artistically and financially.....

For me opportunity lost to make a great intelligent movie that would have departed no more from the book than the film we have before us.

143,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"While it was a long way from perfect, or even great, 'The Da Vinci Code' was better than expected, considering its less than great reputation.

Despite being a box office success, 'Angels and Demons' received mixed to negative reviews, and it's not hard to see why. As an adaptation of the book, which also had some imperfections but was an engrossing and intriguing read, 'Angels and Demons' is extremely poor, with much being cut out or dumbed down, giving the film an over-simplified and over-complicated feel. On its own terms, it's just as problematic and, contrary to some opinions expressed here, inferior to 'The Da Vinci Code', sharing some of the same flaws but amplified while making more on the way.

'Angels and Demons' to its credit is a great-looking film, being beautifully shot with breath-taking locations that could have been utilised more. Hans Zimmer's music score is haunting and accentuates the thriller mood of the film. Tom Hanks gives his role an easy-going charm, while Ewan McGregor has an earnestness while also trying very hard to give his character plausibility (though the character has too much of the opposite for him to properly succeed).

Stellan Skarsgård is similarly strong, as are Victor Alferi and a chilling Nikolaj Lie Kaas.

On the other hand, Ayelet Zurer is a charmless and bland substitute for Audrey Tautou, with little to do and giving her worthless dialogue far too much weight. Then there is Armin Mueller-Stahl's very over-acted villain and Pierfrancesco Favino who spends the whole of his screen time looking hopelessly lost.

The cast are not helped by their (interesting) characters being reduced to mostly simplistic caricatures, and even those not quite as badly affected are underdeveloped. Nor with a truly corny and clunky script, muddled direction by Ron Howard and a story that feels convoluted, to the point of incomprehensibility in places, and childish with plot twists too obvious.

People have said that 'Angels and Demons' had brisker pacing than 'The Da Vinci Code'. Personally, it was partly yes (it is in a way) but largely no. To me the pacing was all over the place, with so many convolutions and parts that feel jumpy it did feel rushed, while the middle act especially lacked urgency and instead dragged like mad.

Overall, not without dishonour, and with enough to prevent it from being completely demonic, but very lacklustre and disappointing, with it also falling far short of being angelic. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Poor,long way perfect even great da vinci code better expected considering less great reputation despite box office success demons received mixed negative reviews hard see adaptation book also imperfections engrossing intriguing read demons extremely poor much cut dumbed giving film feel terms problematic contrary opinions expressed inferior da vinci code sharing flaws amplified making way demons credit film beautifully shot locations could utilised hans zimmer music score haunting accentuates thriller mood film tom hanks gives role charm ewan mcgregor earnestness also trying hard give character plausibility though character much opposite properly succeed stellan skarsgård similarly strong victor alferi chilling nikolaj lie kaas hand ayelet zurer charmless bland substitute audrey tautou little giving worthless dialogue far much weight armin villain pierfrancesco favino spends whole screen time looking hopelessly lost cast helped interesting characters reduced mostly simplistic caricatures even quite badly affected underdeveloped truly corny clunky script muddled direction ron howard story feels convoluted point incomprehensibility places childish plot twists obvious people said demons brisker pacing da vinci code personally partly yes way largely pacing place many convolutions parts feel jumpy feel rushed middle act especially lacked urgency instead dragged like mad overall without dishonour enough prevent completely demonic lacklustre disappointing also falling far short angelic bethany cox,True

The intrigues translate well to film by virtue of Ron Howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.

I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. His portrayal is genuine and earthy, with only the barest glint of the Kip we all knew and loved, back in ""the day."" He is a good dramatic actor and, while I miss his comedic efforts, I do enjoy his more serious performances.

The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican seems to never learn their lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which of course, generated millions in ticket sales.

Although the story of the ""God Particle"" was played down dramatically, and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was entertaining and extremely well done. And, the truth be known, people who have not read the book, will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story, as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.

In fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although that does not lessen the effectiveness, nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.

All in all, this is good for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.

147,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,10.0,"I went to the Midnight showing Thursday night with a curiosity I haven't felt since the DaVinci code. Although the DaVinci code is a better book than film, Angels and Demons is just the opposite, directed and paced perfectly with a blend of action, mystery, and academic researching. Unlike Ron Howard's take on DaVinci code, this story was better in film form because it was concentrated and compressed superbly in the Screenplay.

The acting by Tom Hanks was light years ahead of his performance in DaVinci. He had some emotion behind his work, and the direction helps the actors too. Everyone was great here, especially Ewan McGregor playing an Scottish version of the Camerlengo perfectly, and straight out of the book! He was soft spoken and powerful at the same time. Supporting cast was decent enough, including a bigger formidable menace in the villain who was far more intimidating then Silas was.

I loved the cinematography, and it's the best in cinema history although limited in large exterior shots, besides St. Peter's square. The set combined with real locales made this film seem like a vacation to Rome.

As for the academic research, I can honestly say this film is accurate in my mind, being fascinated by the material. It's based on many facts and some theory and so it is easy to decide for yourself what the truth is. And what is probably just Dan Brown's theory. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a serious movie goer. It's a 2 1/2 hour film that feels less then that, a 9/10 score.

148,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,10.0,"Every time a new pope is selected the Vatican blows smoke in the air and it seems as though every time Dan Brown is ready to make another couple million, he blows smoke up an audience's ass. ""Angels and Demons"", sequel to the equally controversial ""The Davinci Code"", will no doubt come under fire from Catholics and movie fans alike, yet still be a license to print money somehow. It's tedious, one-dimensional, bland, and the action (if you even want to call it that) is not only boring but it's also ugly. And as for Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard, well, you don't hear much about either one slumming for a paycheck but it looks as though ""Davinci"" has started a trend.  

Hanks reprises his role as symbologist Robert Langdon, this time called to Rome by the Vatican to investigate the re-appearance of the secret scientific sect called the Illuminati. They have captured 4 Cardinals and are threatening to blow up the Vatican with anti-matter (basically much more lethal bomb). It turns into a race-against-time scenario when Langdon and physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) find out that the Illuminati appear to be killing the cardinals at the four alters of science. But are the Illuminati really behind this? They are aided by the Swiss Guard (led by Stellan Skarsgard). While this is all going on, the pope has recently died and the other Cardinals have been sequestered to pick a new one. Overseeing it all is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor).  

Think ""Davinci Code"" without the big reveal in the middle. The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, is just a lot of running around. Langdon uses his theological knowledge to ridiculously make everything his compass. A pointing statue means go that way. A dot on a map here makes a cross so that must be the next place they have to go. C'moooooon! As they race from point A to B, director Ron Howard's rapid camera and Hans Zimmer's pounding musical score are poor substitutes for the plot's lack of thrills. There isn't much action. A one-sided shoot-out where an assassin basically just picks people off, some gruesome deaths (including two where characters are burned alive), none of it entertaining. Howard does a nice job of panning the camera along the various monuments and architecture of Rome but he can't save this tedious plot that completely jumps the shark in the third act with an obvious and hooey-filled conclusion.  

Hanks is a pro at comedy and drama but he gets next to none of those things here. Instead he's a stuffed-suit without the slightest hint of personality, spewing out knowledge but never anything worth caring about. McGregor gets a nice speech about the religion vs. science debate, which he knocks out of the park, and Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller Mueller Stahl both offer some menacing intrigue but these characters suffer from a script that relies heavily on contrived plot conventions over interesting characters.

Massive chunks have been cut out, including perhaps the second most important character - leaving it disappointing, void and meaningless. If you enjoyed the book, perhaps give this a miss to preserve the memory The moving speeches are missing, the characters are developed very poorly so you find yourself not particular interested in any of them. It doesn't even feel as they had to cut it out due to time constraints as what is left feels very pedestrian. The first film was a little disappointing but still worth watching in it's own right but I fear this poor story ""based on the a book"" seals the fate for the rest of film series

It's about a serial catholic killer killing off people using codes and symbols.

It was a very suspenseful move. It had a good story and freaky scenes. A&D Is based a book. I've never spent a second on the book therefore iunno how accurate this movie is to the natural source. I'm pretty sure it was butchered like a Yulin festival Market.

What can be learned?: that the world uses symbols and codes to communicate and 90% of people are oblivious to it.

151,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"I find it so weird that this movie is the second in Robert Langdon's Hollywood saga, but the first in the book saga. I only read the third book by now, and I didn't feel like I was missing key information from the previous books, so I guess this is why the movie's order does not matter.

If you are seeing this review, know that this is the second movie based on the first book. And I didn't read the first two books. We cool? Alright.

Oh, and I'd like to remind you that if you care about historical facts and events, and get mad when they say something that is not accurate, then I think you are going to be pissed as you probably were when you watched (or if you watch) The Da Vinci Code (2006). I'm looking at this movie from the ""I want to be entertained"" perspective. I care if the movie was entertaining or not. This is not a documentary, so I didn't watch it to get facts. Now I think we are cool.

We watch Langdon on his quest to find an antimatter container that can potentially destroy the Vatican in a cataclysmic explosion. All while trying to rescue four Pope-wannabees from the hands of a hitman hired by the Illuminati. Yeah, when Illuminati is involved, you know you are in for some good conspiracy stuff.

This movie is basically a carbon copy of the first movie. This does not mean the movie is bad. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too. The difference is that now we are in the Vatican fighting a different group and watching different theories unfold.

Is what you see in this movie true? I don't know. Does it really matter... If this is not a biography or a documentary, we can see it as fiction. In fiction, everything is valid. Dan Brown might say anything to make his work looks cooler and attract more viewers. I'm OK with that.

Overall, cool like the first one. Nothing new other than new conspiracy theories and a different kind of threat.

Director Ron Howard missed it in the last 20 minutes and you have that odd after-taste once the movie is finished.

The movie started with the death of the Pope and is followed by the theft of a canister containing Anti-matter. From there, a Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon takes over. The story is well written by Dan Brown, which never lost the attention of the reader in its novel form. Akiva Goldsman did a fine job in adapting the story as a screenplay. There was enough of wit thrown in extremely fast paced story making sure that you will not get bored.

The good point that is to be noted is Ron Howard has learned from his past mistakes of adapting the Dan Brown novels. Davinci Code was a slow paced movie and it really never kept the viewer riveted to the plot. Also, in trying to stick to the novel, it made fun of itself at points. But, Angels & Demons has lot of deviations from the original novel which resulted in a better movie. Actually, Davinci Code was a failure as a movie. You will enjoy the movie only if you have already read the book. But, A&D can be enjoyed by people who haven't read the book also.

Vettoria Vetra was one thing I hated in the movie. The actress who did that role is relatively unknown and as expected, Ayelet Zurer could not make her presence felt anywhere in the movie. I still wish Ron has opted for Monica Belluci.

Which makes it slightly better than the ""Da Vinci Code"", if you like your movies to be simple and/or straightforward. Whereas Da Vinci was more complex and therefor not entirely satisfying for the mainstream audience it was targeting, this one knows exactly what it wants.

I haven't read the books, the movies are based on, but as it appears the movies took some liberties. Angels and Demons as a book is a ""prequel"" to the Da Vinci Code, but here it is played out as a (sort of) Sequel. Tom Hanks reprises his role and the hunt begins early on. The pace picks on and it never really slows down, which is good, because then you would start thinking and you would see many flaws ... As it is, the movie is solid in what it tries to achieve.

I give Hanks an A+ for all the dialog his character, our kindly Harvard Professor, had to spout out in relation to the historical, or is it hysterical?, relevance of the Catholic Church, in relation to electing a new Pope with some of his brethren having to go through some twists and turns. When the film finally ended, and the fires had died down, I kept thinking, ""there by the grace of God, go I...""

161,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.

So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.

Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.

The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.

Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.

Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid.

Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie.

Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.

A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.

Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.

I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work.

165,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.

The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.

Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.

Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.

This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.

The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.

This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.

Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.

It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.

Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible.

Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled.

167,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,8.0,"Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.

With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.

Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.

Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.

The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.

Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.

If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",Good,da vinci code introduced us robert langdon knack solving puzzles angels demons ups ante providing huge puzzle hour limit cast award winning actors ron howard good job directing story easy follow even easier accept da vinci code threw many angles short time quick bathroom break would leave bit confused return feel angels demons plot action kept interest level peaked throughout cardinal strauss armin easily favorite character movie portrayal elitist yet misunderstood rank catholic church good combined victim treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor find choosing sides immediately upon introduction great amount tom hanks time film focuses story character development well enough introduction first movie unfortunately found ayelet zurer character vittoria vetra unnecessary femme assistant quest since lines bit limited seemed much like afterthought play key role beginning things soon fades background langdon familiar necessary partner plot one organizations catholic church wronged past quite sought revenge artistic manner men church kidnapped set executed specific times ultimate end church happen robert landon brought help decipher clues teams beautiful vittoria vetra scientist witnessed colleague die hands church enemy music staying relevant cinematography beautiful could chime menial things makes angels demons absolutely work conclusion far one amazingly surprising endings seen movie impressed hit like anyone else appreciate great movie wraps quite tight drops pretty bow needless say left theater pleased movie entirety religious unsure movie offend catholic principles say davinci code painted catholicism shady group sadists angels demons paints much lighter brush church shown collective good men made suffer sins evil misguided men wore colors even infiltrated modern ranks,True

You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.

You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.

But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.

So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.

Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.

What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable.

172,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.

Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead.

Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors).

The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.

Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?).

173,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.

The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.

The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.

AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.

The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.

It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.

174,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!

Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.

As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.

I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!

Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.

175,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.

Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.

Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance.

They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.

The novel and bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I have read. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of that complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable and the movie frustrated my expectations.

177,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.

Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.

Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.

The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",Average,doubt ron howard great hero movie proved truly professional skilled director perfectly understood nature dan brown novel aim production thus result well made well performed product certainly top movie dan brown wrote impressive thriller made action suspense paradoxical surprising twists aim selling ron howard spares effort succeeds rendering thrilling engaging story based well consolidated narrative outline find trustworthy hero robert langdon capable unraveling every mysterious sign leading us shocking finale everything course sounds excessive crescendo excess limit ridiculous worth underlining typical capability hollywood great productions take job seriously make good product nothing viewer conscious real nature displayed counts final result aesthetically good entertaining movie indeed evidently movie like book represents threat unbreakable solidness roman catholic church even less faith real faithful people fears reluctance clerical authorities movie distributed sounded little excessive indeed end even romano gave favourable review even movie least offers new interesting perspective ancient let admit quite probably fashion dichotomy science religion pretext build strong till end entertaining story still able attract millions viewers world remaining nonsense forgivable whole cast prove good performances tom hanks certainty beginning however opinion ewan macgregor camerlengo interesting character one langdon interesting exchange faith actors even pierfrancesco favino contribute enthralling atmosphere story,True

So with that said, this probably wasn't one of the most exciting movies I've seen this year though it did get better as the movie went on. Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go. Ron Howard provides his own compelling direction to the fore though, like I said, it didn't completely jell for me.

180,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by ""Angels & Demons"", the follow-up to the ludicruous ""The Da Vinci Code"", where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.

Actually a prequel of ""The Da Vinci Code"" novel, the events in ""Angels & Demons"" is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.

Lecturing and pontificating, ""Angels & Demons""' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist.

181,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"It is the mark of a truly talented director to smoothly flow between Oscar nominated dramas and big budget summer blockbusters, as is it to take the criticisms of a previous franchise instalment and buff and polish the sequel into a superior, smoother film. That is precisely what director Ron Howard does with the second Dan Brown adaptation Angels & Demons, cleverly folding what would be bloated subplots and somewhat ridiculous chapters into a more streamline narrative; mostly loyal but cleverly translated.

Howard re-unites with Tom Hanks, who again stars as symbologist Robert Langdon. A prequel to the mega-hit The Da Vinci code on paper but interpreted as a sequel on film Angels & Demons progresses more quickly, talks less, features some solid supporting performances and has a spectacular final, effects-driven climax. Alas, even with most of the right moves and even more genuine intention Howard's film is simply not as good as the book, neither in cleverness or pacing. In the novel, Langdon's revelations are able to be drawn out and incorporate far more clues and twists and turns. Moreover, the much loved science vs. religion dispute is far better utilized as are the dark history of Rome and the origins and intentions of the secret society of the Illuminati which is the true spine of the story.

Scooped up by the Vatican late one evening and jetted off to The Vatican, Robert Langdon again finds himself in danger adjacent to history, religion and ancient lore. Following the death of The Pope, and the subsequent induction of the next, an old threat rears its head once again. The ancient society of The Illuminati has come for revenge after centuries of suppression and secret annihilation at the hands of the church. Marring the ancient tradition of papal election is the kidnapping of the four preferiti (the cardinals most favoured to success the late Pope) and a bomb threat which could boast a devastating end to Vatican City. Langdon follows the ancient clues of the Illuminati along with a lovely scientist (Ayelet Zurer) who created the bomb which now threatens them all, Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Camerlengo McKenna (an excellent Ewan McGregor) the Pope's temporary successor and adopted son. Time runs out as Langdon and his team race to recover the four Cardinals held by a deadly Illuminati assassin (who if I may say is completely badass) and ultimately the bomb.

Aside from the understandable nuances lost in the adaptation, a number of climatic elements were dropped that I found somewhat disappointing. I will not reveal them here, but if you are a fan you will pick them out easily. Thankfully though this will serve as no detriment to those not experienced with the Dan Brown's works and should still unfold as a satisfying finale. Technically, Angels & Demons is impeccable as are the shots of Rome and The Vatican. Howard's choice to assemble an international cast and not concern himself with cramming countless A list stars into the production is admirable and ultimately an asset. Hanks is adequate but is overshadowed by McGregor but helps the cast round out nicely in the end. This will not likely be the last we will see of Robert Langdon and here is hoping Howard et al can one-up themselves again and cap off an entertaining, if uneven, mystery trilogy.

182,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.

The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter.

The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way.

The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets.

However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost).

While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder.

A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.

183,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,2.0,"Angels & Demons (2009) is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling mystery-thriller novel of the same title hat is based on the dark secrets in the history of Catholicism and the fight of the Catholic Church against the underground societies and their influence. There is a lot to like in the new film: the pace is very fast and appropriately so, the views of Rome and its historical and art treasures are gorgeous, as well as the look into Vatican chambers, passages, and catacombs. The lecture which was given by Ewan McGregor (who looked very appealing as a young priest) about history of struggle between Catholic Church and mysterious powerful secret society of ""Illuminati"" over the Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years, or the religion against the science, was quite insightful and illuminating. Tom Hanks who reprised the role of the Harvard Professor Robert Langdon with the obvious gift for solving tricky puzzles and finding the meaning of secret symbols was once again on hand to provide the solution for yet another Catholic Church serious crisis that threatens the very existence of Vatican City and the college of cardinals who gathered from all over the world to elect the new Pope . I should admit that I liked Hanks in this movie much better than in the first adaptation of Dan Brown's historic- religious mystery ""Da Vinci Code"". I also found Angels & Demons much more fun to watch, maybe because in the new film, its creators concentrate on the crime/mystery/thriller/action elements and did not try to add much drama to it.

In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.

All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.

Although Brown wrote ""Angels & Demons"" first, the film version represents this story, which is sympathetic to the Catholic Church, as following ""The Da Vinci Code"" which was seen as hostile to the Church. Whatever the difference in stance towards Catholicism, Brown's work is always terribly formulaic: a twisting plot set over a matter of hours, lots of symbols and signs, considerable running, much desecration of the flesh, the counterbalancing of religion and science, minimal characterisation, and changing perception of key characters. This time it's all cardinals, cathedrals, crypts and catacombs plus a camerlengo scattered over central Rome and the Vatican.

Again Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist does his best with a wooden script (but a better haircut) - at least ""Angels & Demons"" is less wordy than ""The Da Vinci Code"". Again there is only one female character - this time Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer). Scottish Ewan McGregor (who struggles to affect a Northern Irish accent), German Armin Mueller-Stahl and Swedish Stellan Skarsgård each play Vatican officials who may be an angel or a demon. It's hard to work out which is the greatest threat: the Illuminati, an anti-matter bomb or the implausibilities of the plot. Papal bull or curate's egg? - you decide.

187,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Can Robert Langdon save the Catholic Church and prevent Vatican City from destruction? The race is on as Ron Howard's multi-million dollar blockbuster sequel finally hits the big screen. We last saw Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) 3 years ago, when he uncovered the truth behind a secret society. Now, he's called on once again. This time the stakes are higher, the case is deadlier and the mystery is unlike anything he's witnessed. Here, he's called to Rome to study a mysterious death of one of the 4 cardinals. Little does he know that he's tangled up in a war between the Catholic Church and a Secret Society known as the Illuminati (the enemy to the Catholic Church.) He soon learns that a member of Illuminati has kidnapped 3 other cardinals, threatening to kill one an hour and seizing to destroy Vatican City when the conclave begins. There on he goes on the hunt with a brilliant Scientist (Ayelet Zurer) followed by mysterious twists, turns and deaths headed their way. The only question is can they stop the attack in time? Ron Howard's Angels and Demons is better than his first outing (Da Vinci Code) in every single way possible. It's better in terms of quality, story, and entertainment. The suspense started very early (unlike the slow moving Da Vinci Code) and has enough action and great shots of the Vatican to keep you in your seat for at least 2 hours. Think of it as National Treasure meets 24 in Rome. Despite its potential, it also does has some flaws. It's still preachy, preposterous, and somewhat predictable. Did I mention it also felt like it went on for longer than it needed to be? If you're an open minded person, and often use ""That can never happen"" then you then you may want to take this one off your alley.

188,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"I'd heard the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code movie, never read the book, never saw it at the theatre, eventually hired it on DVD (remember hiring DVDs?) and...was pretty bored by it. I've come around to not-minding it on subsequent viewings when it's been repeated numerous times on TV, but I much prefer this second film. I saw this one at the theatre, hadn't read the book...which I think helped me enjoy the movie, as I felt this one was the most interesting/had the best pacing and actually felt like a proper movie mystery/thriller. It's my favourite of the trilogy and the one I've rewatched the most. I think, as a whole, Angels & Demons is just a better-told film. It isn't slow-paced/plodding along with a drawn-out conclusion like The Da Vinci Code was. Although Ron Howard directed all three films in the trilogy, *this* is the one that kept me interested throughout (even during the 'slower' moments). Tom Hanks seems more at ease in his role as Robert Langdon this time around; his likeability ensuring the audience *cares* what happens to him, and his delivery of exposition (of which there is quite a lot) thankfully didn't ever really bore me. I never saw what the big deal was about his hair in the first film, but any who feared that his 'do would be the 'demon' from the title of this film needn't fear, as it's shorter now.

The biggest improvement with this film over its predecessor, I thought, was Langdon's female partner he's paired with this time around. As the intelligent and beautiful Vittoria Vetra (who I found much more interesting than Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu from the first film), Ayelet Zurer is more of an 'equal' to Hanks's Langdon. They make quite the team, and Vittoria proves that she can indeed keep up with him (which is especially impressive since, as I heard Tom Hanks himself say during a radio interview when the film was being released, 'like every beautiful particle physicist...she wears Manolo Blahniks whilst running on cobblestone'). It's a bit of a shame, however, that unlike the beginning and end of the film, the middle is spent with her character and Langdon separated. After enjoying the two of them onscreen together so much at the start of the movie, I was disappointed they split up for what felt like quite a long period of time midway through. The actors have a nice chemistry, there's an ease/comfortableness between them, and I was amused during one scene that showed Vittoria's much more blunt/direct approach to getting what they needed as quickly as possible and Langdon's reaction to it. The two of them also obviously got a lot of exercise during filming, given all the running around that's involved.

Ewan McGregor is another actor who brings an instant likeability to his character, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, and I think the movie benefited from this considering the direction in which the film goes with him. It's important we *like* him. McGregor really owned the last third of the film with his performance, I felt. While there are other somewhat important characters in the movie, I felt these main three were the most memorable. Unfortunately, I wasn't as interested in this movie's bad guy; The Assassin (because *all* of these movies HAVE to have one of those, apparently). Nikolaj Lie Kaas wasn't as intriguing a villain as Paul Bettany's albino monk, Silas, was in the first film (though at least this assassin gives a *reason* for not killing Langdon, despite having several chances to do so, rather than it just being because he's the lead and therefore has plot armour/can't die). Stellan Skarsgård (who I like in some films, but not others) wasn't overly likable here either. Much better were the characters of Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt, who it was fun to notice in this movie after having seen him years later in Seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series Bron/Broen aka The Bridge). His character shares quite a memorably tense scene with Langdon at one point and Lindhardt ensures that his character makes an impact despite limited screentime.

This movie has a sense of humour that the first film didn't, but it's certainly not a laugh riot either, as there are several instances of gruesomeness, thus making it a far more intense film than the first. Hans Zimmer's score helps sell the suspense. The FX used in this movie illustrate the way CGI *should* be used (to help *add* to the film, rather than distract from it). The climax of the movie isn't quite what you might be expecting, as there's more to the story than first appears, and so long as you don't have a problem with reading subtitles, you should enjoy this film. Angels & Demons doesn't take itself too seriously (which is a plus, given the far-fetched circumstances) and is never dull. Apart from finally finding out just what exactly ""anti-matter"" is, the other thing I learned from this film was that being a Symbologist wouldn't be so bad a job, especially when you get to hang with a beautiful enigmatic Italian scientist.

189,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,1.0,"While ""Angels & Demons"" is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.

From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, ""Angels"" is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of ""Da Vinci,"" especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.

Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to ""Angels & Demons,"" the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.

Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece.",Poor,angels demons means great film least manages consistently solid places head tails sorry predecessor mildly creepy opening mildly exciting finish angels fairly effective thriller plot bears quite similarities da vinci especially concerning supporting characters introduce strong device present first film stop robert langdon journey rome works excellent director howard seems scenes good feel eerie suspense gruesome reveals furthermore plot takes whole new direction lasts fitting slightly underwhelming climax thusly plot proceeds first frame last following part footsteps professor langdon played pretentiously yet tom hanks seems harvard professor one must bitterly sarcastic everyone deliver dragging monologues history long overstay welcome fact according angels demons said camerlengos ewan mcgregor plays film camerlengo convincingly pouring endless dull speeches nature faith mankind fault case lies wholly hands screenplay strangely enough however screenplay gives words vittoria vetra apparent female lead played inoffensively zuret stellan skarsgard armin fortunately fare better roles despite shortcomings areas cast delivers whole leading one wonder film better real culprit twist worthy dan brown novel screenplay movie drags minutes matching inspired thrill monologue piece unnecessary historical jargon beautiful shots beat bad pacing case fact forty minutes film could scraped away great effect sadly said forty minutes cut film bad masterpiece,True
190,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,5.0,"I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.

There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.

Although they did film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.

This movie should be received better by the critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie.",Average,premier movie last night rome expert book however great deal changes book movie pacing movie much faster davinci code many things trimmed otherwise would hour movie many things also changed give movie fast pace think matters feel movie works well hanks brown company things book would appear implausible movie form giving spoilers except say ending movie handled slightly different way leonardo vetra found also different see movie might interested reading book get full details story minor details also cut movie although film rome recreate interior shots since went walking tour rome day movie say interior sites authentic look feel kohler movie much shown cern hanks good job interesting scenes involving vatican archives course access area sure anyone actually knows vatican archives look like eyelet zurer break movie victoria vetra good job eye candy hanks movie received better critics public never know ron howard mentioned several times interviews saw cast movie movie,True
191,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,9.0,"The Da Vinci Code movie was received with a mixture of enthusiasm and disappointment when it first arrived. The fans of the book couldn't wait for it, the Catholic church were going mad about it being released, and the average person was being shepherded to see a movie that they just wanted to know what all the media attention was about. I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit I was looking forward to it. I loved the book and wanted to see a great adaptation. I admit I enjoyed the movie, though a lot really didn't, but I will admit its slow moving, a bit tedious and way, way too faithful to the book. However I had read Dan Brown's other Langdon novel before Da Vinci Code, and I always found Angels and Demons the far superior story. And so here is the inevitable adaptation, and much like the books I prefer Angels and Demons. Demons is a fast paced, beautifully shot and brilliantly acted piece of popcorn entertainment. Yes it has its flaws, the story is still a bit all over the place, and various changes from the novel are not very welcome in my eyes. But for the most part this is a piece of superior entertainment, and after the disaster of Wolverine it is nice to see a sequel with a bit of thought behind it.

So onto the acting. First off is Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. First things first, the hair has been improved, I know that was a huge distraction for a lot of people in its predecessor. Hanks is pretty good here, I'm not going to lie and say he's incredible, as sadly Langdon isn't the greatest character ever. His motivations are vague at best. Still for the material he is given he makes the most of it. Ewan McGregor gets a great role in this movie, he was always the character that intrigued me most in the novel and McGregor does him justice. I won't spoil about him, but you understand after the halfway mark why such a famous actor was cast in the seemingly unimportant role. Ayelet Zurer does a great job as Vittoria Vetra, but the lack of screen time she gets in comparison to how much she is in the book really did frustrate me. Stellan Skarsgård is a bit wasted and I'm not too sure why he signed on for it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl is my personal favourite, have never really encountered the actor before, but his performance definitely is a highlight.

The key to Angels and Demons superiority is in the pacing. Da Vinci Code had very sluggish moments and too many endings for its own good. Here the movie is set over a night, and it works all the better for it. The plot zips along, and all the talky dialogue is usually done while driving or running to the next location to prevent a murder. The murders themselves are shot superbly, although the Air murder is nowhere near as gory as depicted in the novel. The Fire and Water murders are superb though. I liked the execution of the twist for the most part, and I don't think it was as blatantly obvious as I feared, considering it completely threw me when I read the book. The helicopter bit from the novel however is still ludicrous, and the whole antimatter scenario is a OTT for its own good. But these are the flaws of the novel, and at least the ridiculous divine intervention garbage has been scrapped.

Overall Angels and Demons is a fun thrill ride for the summer. Its a superior movie to Da Vinci Code, and I just hope The Lost Symbol (the upcoming Dan Brown novel) is good enough to warrant Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to sign on for yet another one.",Good,da vinci code movie received mixture enthusiasm disappointment first arrived fans book could wait catholic church going mad released average person shepherded see movie wanted know media attention first put hands admit looking forward loved book wanted see great adaptation admit enjoyed movie though lot really admit slow moving bit tedious way way faithful book however read dan brown langdon novel da vinci code always found angels demons far superior story inevitable adaptation much like books prefer angels demons demons fast paced beautifully shot brilliantly acted piece popcorn entertainment yes flaws story still bit place various changes novel welcome eyes part piece superior entertainment disaster wolverine nice see sequel bit thought behind onto acting first tom hanks robert langdon first things first hair improved know huge distraction lot people predecessor hanks pretty good going lie say incredible sadly langdon greatest character ever motivations vague best still material given makes ewan mcgregor gets great role movie always character intrigued novel mcgregor justice wo spoil understand halfway mark famous actor cast seemingly unimportant role ayelet zurer great job vittoria vetra lack screen time gets comparison much book really frustrate stellan skarsgård bit wasted sure signed armin personal favourite never really encountered actor performance definitely highlight key angels demons superiority pacing da vinci code sluggish moments many endings good movie set night works better plot zips along talky dialogue usually done driving running next location prevent murder murders shot superbly although air murder nowhere near gory depicted novel fire water murders superb though liked execution twist part think blatantly obvious feared considering completely threw read book helicopter bit novel however still ludicrous whole antimatter scenario ott good flaws novel least ridiculous divine intervention garbage scrapped overall angels demons fun thrill ride summer superior movie da vinci code hope lost symbol upcoming dan brown novel good enough warrant ron howard tom hanks sign yet another one,True
192,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,6.0,"Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.

Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a ""wait, it's at the chapel"" or ""Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!"" or ""No, that's not it, it's in the sewer"" or ""Wait, it's in my hat!""

It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.

Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was ""message"" like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero.",Average,angels demons follows heels da vinci code movie something really excited either way case macguffin leading characters silly adventure yes make mistake silliness disguised pompous seriousness jesus christ virgin mary fallacy well cube blow vatican city macguffin used way hitchcock clever meant used ideal science religion illuminatti war catholic church going use piece science blah blah whatever put mildly macguffin like would fine use characters story transparent go much focus review something simple angels demons exciting thriller drama twists turns happen rapidly much exposition swear screenwriters trying law order indeed would even blame dan brown dull jerkiness plot read book assume original text might fun way airplane paperback books move along pieces food thought also indeed consensus angels demons better book da vinci code even less controversial cinema something else every five minutes get wait chapel wait church give map sewer wait hat constant string gotchas guided suspenseful hand slick hollywood filmmaker ron howard made good movies day beautiful mind even star tom hanks apollo slightly element frankly hacks way thicket plot points explanation occasional moments striking hanks knocking one glass windows ever hard break losing oxygen vatican archives ultimately really get dan brown may wanted see sense looking religion catholicism seeing hypocrisies underneath science rules secretly would bad thing let people see science academia rules superstitions lasted millenia long ultimately already leaving mind part happened message like really compelling another rickety blockbuster machine really please hardcore fans book looking tom hanks superhero,True
193,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,4.0,"There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.

The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.

And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.

Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.

The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.

Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD.

194,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2,7.0,"My Take: While it's not as detailed as the novel, A&D maintains a fast pace and a thrilling build-up, improving upon its predecessor.

I haven't read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before seeing Ron Howard's movie adaptation, however I did read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS prior to Howard's big-screen take on the 2nd (but in the chronology of the novels, the 1st) Robert Langdon saga. I managed to read halfway through before deciding to go see the movie and avoid being disappointed that it wouldn't be half as good as its source. And sure enough, the movie is not as detailed and complex as the novel, already abridging half the novel into its first hour. But that, I guess, is rightfully so. While it does leave a few interesting points dangling, ANGELS & DEMONS is a first-rate thrilling piece of entertainment. Whether or not it has a rushed narrative, the fast pace still keeps the story moving and the novel's necessary bits of excitement don't disappoint on screen.

Tom Hanks is back, this time with a much nicer hairdo, as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned by the Vatican Police when a crisis is currently being held in the Holy See during the election of a new Pope. My, have the tables turned! Even after ""exposing"" the greatest Catholic cover-up in THE DA VINCI CODE, the Catholic church now runs to him for help. What irony! Anyway, the threat is the Illuminati, a sacrilegious society once devoted to proving that science, not religion, makes the world go round, resurrecting after hundreds of years to exact vengeance. They have already set an explosive device within its walls and is set to explode at midnight. That little McGuffin is the Antimatter, the exact opposite of our own matter, stolen from CERN in Geneva. Instead of being used as a superior power source at it is intended to be, it's now being used as a sort of bomb that will reduce the Holy See into rubble. Secondly, the four possible candidates for being the next Pope (the Preferiti) have been kidnapped and is set to be killed within four churches in Rome. Which ones? Only Prof. Langdon knows for sure, once again configuring a series of clues that will lead them to ""The Path of Illumination"", the Illuminati's hideout, and the possible location of that precious antimatter. With a little help from the tenacious and inquisitive Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer of MUNICH), they accompany the Vatican Swiss Guard across the streets of Rome as Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch ticks urgently.

I can smirk at a lot of things missing from the pages to film reels, but the film gives me very little time for that. Mr. Howard rightfully keeps the pace efficient and gripping, giving us little time to rest easy as even we feel the urgency of the hour. Though usually convicted of being miscast, Hanks makes a mostly apt Langdon (not so much of an action hero, but more of a thinker). Zurer seemingly lacks the greater spunk of the novels depiction of Vittoria, but still gives the role a fine spin. Although, it is quite a waste that the intimate relationship between Langdon and Vittoria are rarely given any depth. Ewen McGregor would have been a total miscast in the role of the Camerlengo, but he makes a dignified man-with-the-robe.

With the expense of deeper character development and more detailed clarification of the events, A&D succeeds at being first-rate, fast-paced entertainment, something that Howard's previous Brown opus, THE DA VINCI CODE, sorrily missed. I liked THE DA VINCI CODE, but even I must agree that the thrills and excitement are burdened by some of its self-indulgence. ANGELS & DEMONS rightfully makes up for that.
