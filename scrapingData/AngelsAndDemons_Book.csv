So, this is a re-read for me BUT I didn’t remember anything from the previous read. Some of these things may be considered spoilers but I don’t think they are spoilers.
Pros
This book is a bit info-dumpy but I really enjoyed it. I didn’t find it to be too heavy and I just love learning new things in books. I can appreciate the amount of effort and research that went into the making of this book. I loved the writing style during the chapters of the Hassassin. I don’t really read thrillers but I think I will if thrillers were more like this. The discussion of religion and science is wonderfully done and I think discussed from multiple sides, which I appreciated.
Cons
The pacing for two reasons. One, this book is supposed to span across a 24-hour period of time and I thought that was a poor choice. Somehow, we are supposed to believe that thousands of other people have never put these clues together and these two people managed it in one day. Second, we would have some scenes that spanned a lot of pages and chapters and then others were a short number of pages and I felt were rushed. The chapters in the Hassassin ‘s point of view, I didn’t care for. I don’t really think they added much to the story",Positive,Positive,stars remember anything previous read things may considered spoilers think spoilers pros book bit really enjoyed find heavy love learning new things books appreciate amount effort research went making book loved writing style chapters hassassin really read thrillers think thrillers like discussion religion science wonderfully done think discussed multiple sides appreciated cons pacing two reasons one book supposed span across period time thought poor choice somehow supposed believe thousands people never put clues together two people managed one day second would scenes spanned lot pages chapters others short number pages felt rushed chapters hassassin point view care really think added much story,True

Action mystery/thriller, this is a prequel to the Da Vinci Code with a violent showdown between the Illuminati and the Vatican, plus the two MCs (symbology at MMC and physicist FMC) trying to stop them.

Characters- bland, dialogue is funny in a cliche hokey way. Our main characters each suffered a Traumatic Event as a child that gave them very specific worldviews for the rest of their lives… meh. Also, FMC Vittoria the Bio Entanglement Physicist was particularly ludicrous, with her incessant references to “ah yes I know this Obscure Skill that comes in handy during Plot Event because a dolphin taught it to me” or some shit. MMC is The Hot Professor who does water polo, is super smart, but just doesn’t have a need for women in his life right now. Plus he’s fucking indestructible. Anywho, this is a plot book, just laugh and move on. 

Plot- whew, so many twists and turns! I was hooked for a long while even though I don’t like history. The first really tense portion (for the first cardinal) and then the last portion were the best. In between the action lagged a bit, and the author has a habit of interjecting flashbacks or wordy descriptions of scenery into  what *should* be tense scenes. 

Writing- a step up from the Da Vinci Code, which I found almost unreadable when I tried it years ago. Yes, there are some cheesy cliffhangers and foreshadowing. (“Robert was scared now. Little did he know, later that day he’d be in more danger than ever before. <chapter ends>”). Skimming is your friend. I can only read about Roman architecture for so long.

There’s some messaging about religion vs science that got a little preachy imo, though the author ends on a fairly neutral stance.

Robert Langdon is a professor who focuses on religious lore and symbols. With that being said, his life isn’t that adventurous but that changes when he gets a call that wakes him up and sends him on a flight across the world in search of the illuminati. It’s up to his knowledge and the help of a new colleague to try and stop them from the terror they launched across Rome.

I’m not big into thrillers because of some of the anxiousness I get from it but I really enjoyed this one. I think because this isn’t my usual genre, I was even more surprised than most discovering the mysteries along the way. I appreciated that the author wasn’t afraid to provide some more realistic outcomes and didn’t make it easy for Robert. The ending was crazy and I didn’t expect it at all.

Before reading this book, I thought that this is one of those mass fiction books, which lack originality (because of reviews from friends) . I wasn't completely wrong. There are commercial elements sprinkled here and there. But the book is not infested with them.

EDIT:

Okay, review time.
First off let me say that I held off reading this book for way too long, and that it is NOT JUST AN ADULT BOOK. Pre-Teens and above WILL understand this book.
Now let's get to the good stuff.
This book started off at an interesting pace, you get a vibe that the protaganist will definitley be interesting, and some major forshadowing led me to believe this book would be filled will twists and surprises.
The writing is what reeled me in. Ever since reading some amazing series (The Demonata, Cirque Du Freak, The Hunger Games etc) I was looking for something equally thrilling and surprsing, the fact that Angels and Demons was that series never crossed my mind.
As I was saying, the writing was descriptive, enthralling, and easily imaginable.
From page one Robert Langdon's first adventure flowed at an endlessley brilliant pace.
Why am I rambling? I need to actually describe it.

In the very beginning when Robert Langdon is called upon the first ambigram really had my mind soaring, wondering what could lie ahead. The blurb on the back was interesting and made me open the book quickly. I was in Italy where few books at a library were in English. This was, so I grabbed it. Starting off the story was definitley not thrust into a fast beginning, but it was an easy beginning that you sunk into and were fascinated in.

The story from there picked up and after countless events I was left with my mouth hanging wide open, but my fingers constantly flipping pages. The story's main plot is (This is not a spoiler: It says it on the back) That there's a bomb in The Vatican, and Professor Robert Langdon must go through a series of clues to help stop the bomb from going off.

This book takes place in 24 hours, which I was sure was impossible. This book isn't super tiny! It's a good sized book, and yet it was brilliantly executed in a 24 hour time range.

After reading about antimatter and the scientific studies I was fascinated and just kept reading so I could simply learn more about the amazing scientific facts contained in the book. The book mentions so many advanced terms and yet it's executed in a way that is easily understandable and for that I give Dan Brown Props.

By the time Langdon was in Rome, I was highly fascinated I wasn't expecting so many surprises i'd recentley read, and had no idea that those surprises were minor.

After having just been to Rome, the scenes and settings in the book were so vivid in my mind that it made me understand so much better and my heart was racing as I remembered the amazing spots and how these scenes took place.

I must say, this book is an awfully creepy one at times. It's sometimes bloody, and sometimes simply horrid, the idea of the criminals and whatnot, it's sometimes a tad hard to read for some people I imagine. Me, having dealt with books that are insanely gory, disturbing, and repuslive enjyoed the book and would read it late into the night. I read this book very quickly.

WOW, i'm getting distracted. Back to the actually story.

One of the main things I really enjoyed and kept me reading so quickly were the characters. The Camerlango, The Swiss Gaurd, Langdon, Vittoria, all of these characters had such history in them and were so dang interesting to meet. I felt like there was so much more unraveling than I would have needed, but it was wonderful! These characters actions often surprised me.

During the story I was shocked by Dan Brown's obviously extensive research. The perfection of the clues and Path of illumination and way everything mixed togethor was pure genius, I was shocked and kept wondering how such things could work, but having been in Rome I knew it was all so true!

I still wonder if this book is fiction.... Just kidding :)

The amazing plot and wonderfully executed story let me along through the climax of the story.
Woops, I'm sorry I just made a mistake.
There was no climax, the whole book was a climx!

The beginning was shocking and had your heart racing. The middle was fast and mysterious and thrilling! The ending was shocking and brilliant! The climax was all of it!

Since I won't reveal spoilers I must skip to my reaction to the ending.

The Ending: Okay, the ending was amazingly shocking. After a huge event happened, I thought it was all over, all questions were answered, everything was set straight, the story could end.

But no, there were a decent 100 pages (give or take) left and I wasn't sure why. Well, I SURE got an explanation.

The story after what seemed like a content ending had only one prominent mystery, which Langdon hadn't encountered yet. When he did, the following shock was amazing.

A huge surprise and betrayel (You guys know what i'm talking about) followed and an amazing revealance had my jaw nearly falling off! I was so surprised and raced through the end.

This story was brilliantly written, shocking executed, perfectley paced, amazingly surprising, and fantastically imaginative.
This story is one you CANT miss, and I highly recommend this book.

45,https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/4d0ec247-c054-4e6e-ad15-459003b999c3,4.0,"I adore the Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown. Ever since I read The Da Vinci Code, I’ve been making my way through the series. Although, I’ve been reading it in the most out-of-order you could ever imagine. And that’s the beauty of this series. It doesn’t matter where you begin. With the last, Origin, in the middle, The Lost Symbol, or with the very first, Angels and Demons.

If Dan Brown is a good writer or not. If his books are good or not. One thing is for sure. Wherever Robert travels, the reader travels with him. Brown’s descriptions of places, buildings, and history make the reader travel. And Rome and the Vatican are two places I’m somewhat familiar with because of my architecture degree. I’ve studied some of the places the story refers to. I’ve studied those Renaissance artists so prevalent in the streets and buildings of Rome. And so, I felt I was right there next to Robert, racing against time.
 Speaking of time, that is probably my biggest criticism of the story. Like all Robert Langdon books, this is a big book. Close to 500 pages. And the story spans 24 hours. It’s a constant race against the clock. Although how much information is being given, it slows the story down. And so, there’s a mix of fast-paced plot breaking at times for context, consequently taking away the trilling memento. The passing of time between chapters also isn’t constant. In some, no time passes at all. And in others, there’s a gap. At times, that made the story feel a bit weird, and it broke off the urgency to keep moving.

Other than that, there isn’t much else I didn’t enjoy about his story. Brown has a gift for mixing fiction with reality in a way you can’t distinguish both. Unless it’s a topic you are very knowledgeable about, there’s no way to separate what are theories and myths from facts. And it’s this mixture that makes the story real and incredibly engaging. It’s about the journey of exploring these secret organisations and creating an engaging narrative that sucks you in. Making you wish everything to be true because it would be a great story. It’s taking conspiracy theories and writing and adventure to uncover them. And what if 90% is fiction? There’s also no map behind the Declaration of Independence, and it’s a lot of fun to follow that story. Even if some details aren’t correct, feeding enough facts makes you believe in everything.

Also, Dan Brown follows a formula. Going from The Da Vinci Code to Origin, it’s very on the nose. And so, I was curious to see if the same formula was used in Angels and Demons. And in a way, it was. The Robert Langdon books have all the same premise: someone was murdered, there’s a strange symbol, Robert is called, he’s clueless about the crime and sometimes the victim, and the symbol takes him on a journey across a city to uncover something. This is a constant. Although in The Da Vinci Code and Origin, I also saw a formula for the final revelation, the real killer. And luckily, that was a little different. I could predict the one at fault in Origin, and when I read Angels and Demons, I expected to uncover the culprit the same way. But it didn’t work. And I’m glad it didn’t. It would be a bummer after reading only one book of the Robert Langdon series predicting the killer in all the other books after 100 pages. Still, he has a formula that works and continues to use it. And I’m fine with that.

Since Angels and Demons was the third book I read in the series, I was already aware of some background information about Robert. Although, since this is the first one published, Robert’s past is fully explained. His claustrophobia is one of his personality traits. That detail appears in every book (that I’ve read so far). Although in later books, it’s never fully explained where it comes from. And it makes sense since it was explained in the very first book of the series. I’ve always liked Robert, and I adore how he always knows everything, and reading Angels and Demons, allowed me to know him at a deeper level. It’s even somewhat explained why there aren’t any romantic relationships in the books despite Robert always having a beautiful woman sidekick.

I'm a believer that reading anything is good, but I also believe that people shouldn't mistake famous pieces of work to be good.

One thing I do find, though, is that The Da Vinci Code is a much better written novel than its prequel, Angels and Demons. Angels and Demons reads little better than poorly executed fanfiction, in which the hero not only saves the day due to good luck and still gets the girl, despite being put in many situations that would love a mere mortal battered. How many death-defying situations is Langdon put through? How many sarcophagi must he be trapped under? How long must he suffocate? How many miles must he fall through the air?

And then there are the secondary characters. Written in 2000, I can try to excuse Brown for using the Arab as the primary villain and all the accusation it would stir up, but even so, it is a rather stereotypical, and dare I saw, racist move. The lovely lady heroine, Vittoria, has few flaws as usual, and her love with the hero succeeds to the end, having only met twenty-fours earlier. The suspect turns out to be the good guy, and no laws are ever followed through with.

It also gave me a lot of words, thoughts, and messages to ponder, I've taken note of a lot of words, phrases, and locations from this book to search about and dive into ( though I always remind myself this is just a book of fiction so I should not dive much into this rabbit hole) but I still want to look it up, know some facts about it and theorize and connect the novel to some points, for I know that this book will not be created without some fact checking since all named organization and locations are real and not made up, which led me to this whole thought of, how true everything is? how much is fiction in this book? I know, of course, there is a lot of fiction in this novel but how do they correlate to facts?

Now regarding the number of phrases I managed to ponder in from this book, where quite a lot have been on my mind there's one thing I can say is very ""catholic"" Something I can say that makes sense but it is very unethical:
With two deeds, Jesus had opened their eyes. Horror and Hope. The crucifixion and the resurrection

This is how the Catholic church for me works, they always condemned evil around us, planting horror in our life to make people HOPE for something that I can say is Miracle(?) or Salvation.
This also correlates and is proof of what Vittoria said:
“You mean the day they stop needing the church,” Vittoria challenged, moving toward him. “Doubt is your last shred of control. It is doubt that brings souls to you. We need to know that life has meaning. Man’s insecurity and need for an enlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan.”

This sound absurd but this is the reality. Religions not just the catholic church inflict fear, show horrors, proclaimed evil, and satan, in order for people to need the church, to need to believe God is the salvation.

Overall (this review is a lot longer now) I will rate this 4/5 an almost perfect score because the novel is still flawed but I will say it is a good read that kept in wanting to turn more pages and read more chapters.

It’s been a long time since I last read a Dan Brown book, but I remember vividly being completely in awe of how amazing it was. However, Angels & Demons was… a different experience.

The Robert Langdon movie adaptations have always fascinated me. To say that I’ve watched Angels & Demons at least 20 times is an understatement, being as it is my favourite out of the three releases. Maybe that was my misstake. Maybe Dan Brown books are just meant to be read without any previous knowledge, the surprise factor being key to the whole experience. Maybe my subconscious expectations were too high.

The storyline of Angels & Demons is incredible, mixing the intricacies and mysteries of Christianity with calculated, dangerous science. The thing about new science and technology however, is that it gets outdated fast. Many of the things mentioned that are ”impossible” are practically child’s play nowadays. Maybe not everybody knows about antimatter, but if you study science in High School you’ve got to at least have heard of it. Additionally, it’s ridiculous that computers can’t make ambigrams! Or, from a writer’s perspective, that there will never be a time in the future where ambigrams will be very easy to procure. I’m sure Dan Brown meant this book to be based in the year 2000, but, personally, it threw me completely off the loop that it was so profoundly based on ”new impossible technology” that didn’t hold up in the real world.

Another thing I found quite annoying, even more so than the previous point, was the constant media presence and its main characters. I did not like the story’s angle from their perspective. It was quite boring and, of course after seeing how they did it in the movie, pretty unnecessary the quantity of pages it got. The journalist was a horrid character, not likeable in the least, and the camerawoman, who seemed to be the only one who caught my interest, fell flat halfway through.

Remaining characters were quite bland as well. Langdon lacked charisma, Olivetti was dislikable but then grew on me and Richter seemed for far too long like a side-side-side character that didn’t really culminate in something truly relevant. Yet Vittoria and Chartrand were great.

Although, nothing beats the awfully written Hassasin. Why was it necessary to make him a sexual predator? Was it truly relevant for the plot? It certainly doesn’t further it, rather it drives from it and loses it’s focus. Also – and maybe it’s just me – but him being Muslim was a weird trait. There was not any true significance to it other than make him brown-skinned and giving him an accent. Why would a Muslim man work for the Illuminati? Wasn’t he religious himself? If not, then why make a big deal of him being Muslim? And if he was, why would he help a satanic group that actively denounces God himself? I’d understand if he was just ”doing a job”, not really caring for who contracted him, but it’s written like he almost worships the brotherhood. It just… did not sit right with me.

Which leads me to the Camarlengo’s speech when he broke conclave… I have never read such religious propaganda in a literature novel before and my eyes rolled so far back it hurt my skull. Yes, it’s the year 2000, but please make it at least seem believable. There’s absolutely no way that the other Cardinal’s would just go along with a Camarlengo breaking conclave, having a 10 minute speech and on top of that bring media presence, who were reporting everything LIVE, into conclave! The previously reserved, mature Camarlengo completely blew his cover for the reader. It became much too obvious that he was involved, thus the later plot twist had no impact. It felt so forced, with Dan Brown writing over and over again how amazing, brilliant, smart and valiant the Camarlengo was for standing up, all from different perspectives to ensure unanimity.

What had been a solid 6 in my mind plummeted to a generous 3 out of 10.

Nevertheless, one of the few things that holds this book up is Dan Brown’s writing style. I understand it’s not for everybody, but it is for me. The quick pace, the change of perspective… I like it. However, the action scenes were not well planned nor well written. They were messy, hard to follow and sometimes made absolutely no sense. For example, the fact that Vittoria didn’t go with Langdon to help Cardinal Guidera when he was branded but instead chose to wander around the church. Yes, she saw a man literally being burned to death and instead took a stroll around to see what else was going on. Langdon immediately ran to help, yet she didn’t. Besides being lazy writing, it felt completely out of character for her.

Lastly, the ending. I… What a way to really nail this book in its grave. It was bad. Too convoluted and took away too much of the significance of the plot throughout. There was no satisfaction to it. After everything that happened, it all boiled down to… a miscommunication? Are you for real?

There’s not much left to say. I can’t with good conscience recommend this book, for its adaptation is far superior. All of the incredible aspects are well reflected in the movie and the insufferable ones thankfully omitted. Maybe I shouldn’t have read the book after the movie.

The content is very far from what I expected..but the plot is fine.

The Da Vinci Code is a lot better, but this one is good.

The book is a little bit detailed and scientific and that is a good point for me.

What else... I am speechless. xD

I'll just make this brief.

Plot/ Topic:
The plot is fine.. I never expected it to be like that.. though I am expecting more. The story is very violent! Just imagine 8 people died that night, correct me if I'm wrong. I like the scientific side of the story.. the antimatter, for me that is an interesting topic and I just wish that that is true! Science is beneficial to mankind, we just have to use it properly. Religion for me is an important thing to mankind, though, you can live without it for I believe that religion is not that matter, it is the faith. I guess, I am not affected by the topic Religion, since this book tackles a lot about Catholicism, and although I am a Catholic, I know that religion is not perfect, it is made by human.. and humans are never perfect. I know that religion is flawed because man is flawed. I also know that religion is just a mere representation of our faith.. Also, the story taught me a lot about the process of having a new Pope also about the rules and so on. Well, I'm too young to know that. I'm 8 or 9 when Pope Benedict XVI was declared as the new Pope.

Setting:
Vatican City. I really wish to go to Vatican someday. I want that... I want to visit that place at least once in my life.. just like Mecca. For me, that is very historical and significant for the Catholics. The setting of the story is fine.. of course, the author has to place it there. I just hope that I am more aware of that place, maybe with that, I'll be able to understand and absorb the story well.

Character:
I love Robert Langdon, I'll always do. He's so great...a nice Symbologist with a mickey mouse watch- but I love the meaning, Stay young at heart. He is always good for me.
Vittoria Vetra is my another bias. I have read the The Da Vinci Code and I will say that Vittoria is a lot better than Sophie.. Her character is more independent, more mature, more logical, more intellectual. I simply love her.. :))
The Camerlengo, he's paranoid! I don't know why he did all of those. He is not a God to act like that, he doesn't have the right to kill.

But at the end of the day, I like it! :)I am really a fan of mystery, detedtive and weird books.",Positive,Positive,angels demons content far expected plot fine da vinci code lot better one good book little bit detailed scientific good point else speechless xd make brief topic plot fine never expected like though expecting story violent imagine people died night correct wrong like scientific side story antimatter interesting topic wish true science beneficial mankind use properly religion important thing mankind though live without believe religion matter faith guess affected topic religion since book tackles lot catholicism although catholic know religion perfect made human humans never perfect know religion flawed man flawed also know religion mere representation faith also story taught lot process new pope also rules well young know pope benedict xvi declared new pope setting vatican city really wish go vatican someday want want visit place least life like mecca historical significant catholics setting story fine course author place hope aware place maybe able understand absorb story well character love robert langdon always great nice symbologist mickey mouse love meaning stay young heart always good vittoria vetra another bias read da vinci code say vittoria lot better sophie character independent mature logical intellectual simply love camerlengo paranoid know god act like right kill end day like really fan mystery detedtive weird books,True

What Dan Brown lacks in character development, good writing skills, modesty, proper research, and not being a bit racist, he tries to make up for with insane plot twists. There were more plot twists shoved in the last ~40 pages of this book than I imagine are in most murder mysteries.

I have to give him some kudos for his imagination - the ideas in the book are exciting in a guilty, trashy sort of way. However, all of his characters fall entirely flat. They are poorly written and undefined. Brown does whatever he wants with them whether or not the action befits the character he's created thus far, until you're left not really imagining a character and more a vehicle by which Brown tries to make his book crazier and crazier.

All of the character description and dialogue is so contrived and cliche, it's maddening. I rolled my eyes every time the lead female character did anything in the story, because every time she did, it was accompanied by some new description of her lithe, Mediterranean body. Give me a damn break. I won't even get into the depictions of the two non-white people in the book (one a sassy, heavy-set, black, female camerawoman and the other a horrifying, vengeful, Arab, Muslim murderer/rapist). You get the picture.

What Brown claims to be factual in the book (mostly bits concerning theology, Catholicism, and the Illuminati, with some advanced physics sprinkled in) are so offbase, it's laughable.

The plot is something like this :- World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization -- the Illuminati. In a desperate race to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and courageous scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, and deserted cathedrals, and into the depths of the most secretive vault on earth...the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.

Angels and Demons is the first book in a series that features chronic bachelor, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious iconology. Doesn't sound that interesting right? Wrong. Langdon is actually a very handy man to have around when the Illuminati resurfaces and murders a physicist by branding a strange symbol on his chest. A physicist who happens to be a priest of the Catholic church and who also believes he has found scientific proof of God's hand in the creation of the universe. Scandalous. Turns out a professor of religious iconology is bloody fascinating, who would have thought? Not me before reading this book.

I love a intelligent, bookish man in tweed and I just really liked Robert Langdon as a character, Mickey Mouse watch and all. Vittoria Vetra on the other hand, is another matter. She is the murdered physicist's adopted daughter and a scientist in her own right. She started off as smart and independent but as the book went on she just became like a prop to the story in order to add an element of eye candy and sexual tension. Sadly, by the end of the book, Vittoria was just a cardboard cut out woman that was inserted into the story for Robert to be distracted by. That was kinda rubbish to be honest and I wished her character had more of a role.

I am not going to deny this book is a page turner, the chapters are short, the tension is high - the piecing together of the puzzle was interesting but I just felt like there wasn't much substance under all of that. Which is odd considering there is a humongous load of historical detail on Vatican City, renaissance artists, symbols, papal politics, etc.  I just wanted a little more of a deeper look into it all. For instance, the identity of the assassin and how he was recruited is never really revealed and was glossed over in favour of the big twist at the end.

Overall, this was a really fun book. Very fast paced and plot driven. It's great for what it is, an engaging, suspenseful thriller. I think it would disappoint someone who wants something with a bit more character development.",Positive,Positive,originally posted angels demons first book series features chronic bachelor robert langdon professor religious iconology sound interesting right wrong langdon actually handy man around illuminati resurfaces murders physicist branding strange symbol chest physicist happens priest catholic church also believes found scientific proof god hand creation universe scandalous turns professor religious iconology bloody fascinating would thought reading book love intelligent bookish man tweed really liked robert langdon character mickey mouse watch vittoria vetra hand another matter murdered physicist adopted daughter scientist right started smart independent book went became like prop story order add element eye candy sexual tension sadly end book vittoria cardboard cut woman inserted story robert distracted kinda rubbish honest wished character role going deny book page turner chapters short tension high piecing together puzzle interesting felt like much substance odd considering humongous load historical detail vatican city renaissance artists symbols papal politics etc wanted little deeper look instance identity assassin recruited never really revealed glossed favour big twist end overall really fun book fast paced plot driven great engaging suspenseful thriller think would disappoint someone wants something bit character development,True

The immense research that was done to create this book, all the way from all of the mentioned churches to works of art should not be taken for granted.

I looked up a lot of the people, places, etc. on the internet as I was reading the book and found that nearly everything he references has a basis in fact (and the places are real of course).

Leonardo Vetra - a brilliant senior physicist, a still-practicing Roman Catholic priest, and the discoverer of a method of creating and safely containing anti-matter - has been found brutally murdered with the word ""Illuminati"" branded on his chest.

The near light-speed, explosive pace at which Brown would have us believe the plot of Angels and Demons could unroll requires what, for some, will be an insurmountable suspension of credibility. But, if you can find your way over that niggling barrier, you're in for some non-stop, rollicking entertainment.

Langdon and Vittoria Vetra, the victim's beautiful daughter and similarly gifted physicist, follow the clues into the heart of the Vatican, host of an enclave of the world's cardinals convened to elect the replacement of the recently deceased pope where they must confront the current incarnation of The Illuminati, a centuries old secret brotherhood of scientists dating from the time of Galileo and the Italian Renaissance. The Illuminati carries out a high profile symbolic execution of the preferiti, the four cardinals most expected to win the papal election, and plans to use a small sample of Vetra's anti-matter to reduce Vatican City to a pile of rubble as a final close to the interminable battle between cutting edge science and Roman Catholic dogma.

Reading Angels and Demons, I find it impossible to criticize Brown's character building skills as an author because, frankly, he didn't even try. Angels and Demons is plot, plot and yet more plot! But my money says it succeeds wildly and is a novel that is not only spectacularly entertaining but should avoid the visceral polarization of its readership that The Da Vinci Code managed to produce. I might go even further. Despite reading from the point of view of a non-practicing and disenchanted Roman Catholic, educated and believing profoundly in the value of scientific research and technology, I would nevertheless suggest that Angels and Demons presents a credible, balanced FICTIONAL story of a climactic confrontation between these two long-time arch-enemies. Ah, heck ... if anything, the scientists come out on the cruddy end of the stick and look more the bad guy than the church! That's OK - that provides a rather nice foil to the outlook one gets from a reading of The Da Vinci Code!

Enjoy! Five stars and unconditionally recommended as a first-rate enjoyable thriller!

I love the part where the book said that we need science and religion in equal measures. Science provides modern and innovative approach towards the common good of people, BUT we need religion to slow that down. According to the book, the world is going out of control because of some scientific issues that are not handled with care or exploited for selfish reasons like wealth and power. Religion's sole purpose, on the other hand, is to promote morals and values that keeps the world's pace toward the future a harmonious transition. What's the common denominator there, you ask? Both aims for the best the future can offer. The only problem is that these two seem to view each other as a competition.

190,https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/4d0ec247-c054-4e6e-ad15-459003b999c3,4.0,"I don’t care what anyone says, Dan Brown can tell a story. I’m a fan. :D

I was hooked the entire time I read and could barely part with my iPad (I read the e-book). It wasn’t the writing that kept me hooked, or even the characters; it was the suspense and the facts Brown shares about religion, art, and history. The suspense made me eager to find out how the story would end, while the facts made me crave to know more.

Despite the slow pace at the beginning, Angels & Demons was an exciting read. I watched the movie years ago when it came out, but had forgotten much of the plot, so I wasn’t spoiled for the end though, leading up to it, I did suspect who the mastermind behind the heinous acts was. I also wasn’t put off by the switches in perspective, which I didn’t expect. We even get to read from one of the antagonist’s perspectives, which didn’t do much for me since that antagonist, the Hassassin, didn’t have much depth.

Actually, almost all the characters lacked depth, but I didn’t care. I was too hooked on the plot. Besides, the focus of the story is the plot, not the characters. If it was the other way around, I would have been sorely disappointed. The plot progressed at a slow pace as Brown allows his protagonist, Robert Langdon, to adjust to the situation he’s flown into. The slow pace also gives Brown time to fill in the reader on prior events and show off Langdon’s extensive knowledge of history, religion, art, and symbology and how great he looks in his tweed jacket, which sometimes annoyed me. It’s obvious that Brown really likes this character.

Another major character is Vittoria Vetra, the daughter of the murder victim. Vittoria was gutsier than I thought she would be, but also a little disappointing too, but that’s probably because I think she was only included so that Langdon could rescue her at the end like a knight rescuing a princess trapped in a tower. Lol, smh. I guess those fantastical elements are part of the reason why I enjoyed the story though they did annoy me.

The resolution also didn’t work for me. The events leading up to the end were exciting, but I couldn’t totally believe method used to get rid of the bomb. Because of the nature of the bomb, I thought it would be impossible to get rid of or dismantle it. And Langdon surviving all that didn’t seem believable either. Though I liked that Langdon felt a surge of courage that led him to rescue Vittoria (and that she saves herself), I couldn’t ignore the racial dynamics of the situation and couldn’t stop thinking of it as a White dude (knight in shining armor) who must prevent the White woman (damsel in distress) from being defiled by a person of color (monster who should be destroyed). I keep going back and forth on this because that Hassassin dude was horrible and I was rooting for Langdon but was happy when Vittoria sorta saved herself and Langdon too.

Anyway, other stuff I liked about this story is the little bits of things I learned, like Hassassin, which were actually real and were a feared sect of Islamic warriors and the word “assassin” is derived from it. I also didn’t know about the Swiss Guard until I read this book. I’ve heard the term used, but didn’t know what they did or that Michelangelo designed their outlandish uniform (well, so people say). I quite like their uniform, though it must make clandestine operations in the field quite difficult (assuming they wear their uniform all the time, which they probably don’t).

Of course, I also enjoyed this story because of the discussion it provides on religion and science and how the two relate to each other. I won’t go much into it, but I like arguments that point out that the two are trying to achieve the same thing and have done so but have used different methods to reach the same goal. I think both are needed to balance each other.

Overall: ★★★☆☆

It was entertaining and I think Dan Brown is good storyteller. I’d like to read another of his books to sample more of his stories.

Quotes from the book:

• “The most dangerous enemy is that which no one fears.”

• “Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbituary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.”

Angels & Demon’s is the first in Dan Brown’s “Robert Langdon” series (with book #2 being the well-known DaVinci Code.) Time and time again, it had been recommended to me by people I work with, insisting that I would love the thriller - but I was intimidated by the 572 page copy held at our local library.

The plot follows the protagonist (and Harvard symbologist) Robert Langdon across America, Switzerland, and Italy to solve a murder, and then save Vatican City from the wrath of the Illuminati. A few other characters join forces with Langdon for the adventure, including the mysterious and incredibly cunning Vittoria Vetra (the daughter of the man who had been murdered.)

**note: reflective subjective review of Dan Brown himself and the book.

I first read this when I was 16. After I have read The Lost Symbol (which was the first Dan Brown book introduced to me)

I didn't know much of Dan Brown back then. I just read books and enjoyed them.

Years later, (this year) I decided to reread this series again. It astonished me how I don't remember details of this book. I knew what it was about but for some reason, not the details. Not what happened.


So yes, I have, miraculously, read the book for the first time again. Unfortunately, it was for this book. (lol)

Back then I knew nothing of the lapses of authors. I looked Dan Brown up recently and saw horrifying reviews! How could this be! The series I have liked 8 years ago, be rated 1-2 stars!

So imagine my confusion when I read it again and did a double take. This..is how he writes..? Is my perspective now tainted due to the number of critical reviews? I did like this story back then, so is there prejudice now?

Perhaps. I have grown and realized some of the writing on the book were.. a lot to be desired.

The story itself though, I do like it.
Flipping through the pages, I couldn't help but notice the secondhand embarrassment I was feeling. (lol) his description of the characters are bit..bland. Formulaic, others would say. And I agree. And reading through the book, I subconsciously already rated the book a 2-3. But when I got to the end, I bumped this up to 4.

The story itself is a masterpiece. I love when people build these intricate ""treasure hunts"" based on actual symbols and clues that we can see around us, much like National Treasure. Nothing but props to Dan Brown for that part of the book. It does, however, lose a star for turning a bit YA every once in a while. It's very well written for most of the book, but certain passages would suddenly seem like they were written for a younger audience, or that Brown didn't expect us to be able to follow what was going on. These passages happened most often during flashbacks or when he was trying to explain something. Every once in a while the dialogue became a little YA too. It doesn't take too much away from the product as a whole, but it does prevent it from being a five-star book, in my opinion.

I also don't really consider this a mystery. For one, though we don't know who the mastermind is, we do know who the assassin is the whole time. Most of the mystery comes from Langdon and Vetra trying to figure out the Path of Illumination. But the reader doesn't really get too involved in figuring that out, because unless you're an Illuminati enthusiast and Italian history buff, you only get the information Brown gives you , as he gives it to you. There's really no way to figure it out before Langon does. That doesn't lessen the story by any means, but I don't consider it a mystery, just a work of fiction.

For some of my followers on this social media, many of you do not know but I am a catholic. And I would like to think of myself as a pretty good one, too. (I know, humble right? 😊)
And despite the fact that I'm a catholic, and despite the fact that this books deals a lot with scandals in the Catholic lifestyle and in Catholic history, I did not find this book it its details in any way offensive.
Just a side note for any other Catholic who is thinking of reading this book.
Now, for the review.
A lot of people, especially those with more knowledge of European history than myself, are not fans of the Robert Langdon series or I Dan Brown himself.
However, this story was so incredibly good, that I didn't care about the subtle jabs at the Catholic faith or lifestyle; I didn't care if any of this were true.
I was just in it for a good story, and I wasn't disappointed.
Reading this in 2017, however, makes some of what happens seem a little cheesy. This is especially true for the Illuminati references. At this point in America (and maybe in some other places, I'm not sure), the word Illuminati is a little overdone, like aliens. A few years ago, everything anyone did was ""Illuminati confirmed"", even some/all of what the government did.

So, I have a lot of mixed feelings about the book that I'm not really sure how to write out. I knew before reading this that Dan Brown and The Davinci Code was pretty controversial. It dealt with some pretty heavy subjects, like religion. I, myself, am not religious so I consider myself pretty ignorant in matters like this. Because of that, I kind of avoided the book and Dan Brown for the longest time because I wasn't sure if I would really get it. But, after a while, I decided to just go ahead and read it. Maybe a lot of things would fly over my head or wouldn't affect me, but it would be an interesting read to say the least.

My final thoughts on it were eventually this: It's an entertaining read at the least, but you have to sort of ""turn off your brain"" if you want to enjoy it. I'm sorry if that doesn't make much sense, I'll try to explain it down below.

I knew that Dan Brown tended to be very ""liberal"" about interpretations on historical events religious matters, so I read with that in mind. There are different things that Dan Brown changes around about history and other similar subjects. Some of these are pretty hard to suspend disbelief for...so it's something that's very hard to work around (I personally just pretended this all was happening in some parallel universe, haha). I don't know if this means that this novel is very poorly written or if Brown just took a lot of artistic licenses, but that's a hurdle I had to overcome in reading this book.

Another thing that Brown does in his writing is that he jumps around a lot from different characters and events. I know that this is supposed to be showing the entire story through different perspectives, but I sometimes feel that it really contributed nothing or was just a waste of space. It also felt jarring at times. Sometimes it would feel there was no focus, and other times it felt like it was cutting off a good action sequence.

Also, there were some things that just seemed...implausible to me. I mean, this entire books kind of relies on you having to suspend your disbelief and having to accept some unorthodox interpretations and whatnot, but it got too unbelievable to me at some times. Like, there are countless researchers and scientists studying these topics, and Robert Langdon was the only guy who could figure these puzzles out? There are quite a few other examples, but they're spoilery so I won't get into them. I'll just say this: some scenes were making me scratch my head.

I don't know if this was just me or not, but did anyone else feel like Vetra could have been completely taken out and the novel wouldn't have really lost anything of substance? I feel like she just fulfills the ""Sexy Foreign Love Interest Trope"". I don't know, it might just be me. The romance itself was poorly written, and I cared very little for it.

There is a whole theme about science vs. religion, which I know is a pretty powerful debate, but the theme didn't really resonate with me, so I can't comment on it. I'm sure people that are more knowledgeable with the subject can comment on this.

One of the biggest issues I had with the book was Brown's writing itself. I can usually overlook bad prose if the story / characters are good, but this wasn't the case here. The writing was pretty choppy to me and not paced really well. There are some weird descriptions here and there and it sometimes felt like a juvenile trying to write more advanced.

But, with everything said and done? I still found it entertaining. It wasn't a boring book at all. I got some enjoyment out of reading it, if just for the fact that it was a mediocre thriller that was able to hold my attention until the end. I've read a lot of books that are so bad or so boring that I wasn't able to finish it. Angels & Demons didn't fall in either of those categories. It's just a fun book with some action that's decent to read. Yes, you have to overcome many hurdles to get some pleasure out of reading this book, but it wasn't absolutely terrible. This might be because I don't know a whole lot about the controversy surrounding Dan Brown and the Da Vinci Code. But if you can suspend your disbelief far enough (and I mean REALLY far) and have a tolerance for mediocre writing...it's not terrible.

And like I said, if you just pretend this book takes place in some alternate universe, it makes it a lot easier.",Positive,Positive,hmm lot mixed feelings book really sure write knew reading dan brown davinci code pretty controversial dealt pretty heavy subjects like religion religious consider pretty ignorant matters like kind avoided book dan brown longest time sure would really get decided go ahead read maybe lot things would fly head would affect would interesting read say least final thoughts eventually entertaining read least sort turn brain want enjoy sorry make much sense try explain knew dan brown tended liberal interpretations historical events religious matters read mind different things dan brown changes around history similar subjects pretty hard suspend disbelief something hard work around personally pretended happening parallel universe haha know means novel poorly written brown took lot artistic licenses hurdle overcome reading book another thing brown writing jumps around lot different characters events know supposed showing entire story different perspectives sometimes feel really contributed nothing waste space also felt jarring times sometimes would feel focus times felt like cutting good action sequence also things seemed implausible mean entire books kind relies suspend disbelief accept unorthodox interpretations whatnot got unbelievable times like countless researchers scientists studying topics robert langdon guy could figure puzzles quite examples spoilery wo get say scenes making scratch head know anyone else feel like vetra could completely taken novel would really lost anything substance feel like fulfills sexy foreign love interest trope know might romance poorly written cared little whole theme science religion know pretty powerful debate theme really resonate ca comment sure people knowledgeable subject comment one biggest issues book brown writing usually overlook bad prose story characters good case writing pretty choppy paced really well weird descriptions sometimes felt like juvenile trying write advanced everything said done still found entertaining boring book got enjoyment reading fact mediocre thriller able hold attention end read lot books bad boring able finish angels demons fall either categories fun book action decent read yes overcome many hurdles get pleasure reading book absolutely terrible might know whole lot controversy surrounding dan brown da vinci code suspend disbelief far enough mean really far tolerance mediocre writing terrible like said pretend book takes place alternate universe makes lot easier,True

And I welcome discussion in the comment section from people who disagree with me. Maybe I just missed something in this celebrated book.

First, I must say that although the author tends to be long-winded, I did enjoy the writing style of it. I liked the details and descriptions of things the characters were seeing: the churches, the cathedrals, the sculptures, etc. After reading the book I searched for pictures of some of the sculptures and I must say that the real thing matched pretty closely with the image I had in my mind's eye. So bravo to Mr. Brown for his word-smithing. Additionally, although the writing *appears* to be complex and intelligent, it is actually very accessible and the 600-ish pages really seemed to fly by. I finished this book in just a few hours. It is very easy to read. Furthermore, hats off to John Langdon for the clever ambigrams!

However, parts of the story just seemed... outright silly. Impossibly silly. Sometimes silly is good, like when you write a children's story about entering a fantastic world called Narnia through a closet. But it's not appropriate for a story in which the author is trying to convince his readers that these are real places and this can happen with real people. For example, would YOU follow a dangerous assassin into a dark place, by yourself, armed only with a little pistol? Would YOU jump out of a helicopter that is 4,000 feet in the air with just a little sheet to break your fall? Would YOU confront a dangerous man alone and tell him to ""confess your sins?"" Every time one of these things happened (and these are just a few examples), I rolled my eyes. It didn't feel suspenseful, it just felt stupid. And -- I don't want to give anything away -- the plot twist at the end of the story... Let's just say it left much to be desired.

And finally -- here comes the controversial part -- the portrayal of the church left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Here we have a book with many, many complaints about how the Church has stifled science for centuries. Many portrayals of corrupt individuals inside the church. Yes, I understand that history can't be denied, and these things happened, but out of all the characters in the book, there were perhaps two that actually came across as real Christians. And there are people who say, ""In this book, the Church comes out looking pretty good, what are you upset about?"" The only reason the Church comes out looking pretty good is because of an elaborate deception. The string of events in this book is shameful, really, from a Christian point of view. The person behind the killings is a jaded Catholic priest -- forgiveness comes with the territory! And then the deception, that was the most insulting of all: Please, don't tell anyone who murdered these people because it will make people lose faith in God? Really? Are Christians so empty-headed that they need an elaborate lie to maintain their faith? What's next, Mr. Brown? Are you going to write a novel about how Robert Langdon walks on water to give Christians faith in God? Hmm?

In short, I found this novel just a little too shallow for my taste.",Positive,Negative,going try hardest give book fair review really welcome discussion comment section people disagree maybe missed something celebrated book first must say although author tends enjoy writing style liked details descriptions things characters seeing churches cathedrals sculptures etc reading book searched pictures sculptures must say real thing matched pretty closely image mind eye bravo brown additionally although writing appears complex intelligent actually accessible pages really seemed fly finished book hours easy read furthermore hats john langdon clever ambigrams however parts story seemed outright silly impossibly silly sometimes silly good like write children story entering fantastic world called narnia closet appropriate story author trying convince readers real places happen real people example would follow dangerous assassin dark place armed little pistol would jump helicopter feet air little sheet break fall would confront dangerous man alone tell confess sins every time one things happened examples rolled eyes feel suspenseful felt stupid want give anything away plot twist end story let say left much desired finally comes controversial part portrayal church left sour taste mouth book many many complaints church stifled science centuries many portrayals corrupt individuals inside church yes understand history ca denied things happened characters book perhaps two actually came across real christians people say book church comes looking pretty good upset reason church comes looking pretty good elaborate deception string events book shameful really christian point view person behind killings jaded catholic priest forgiveness comes territory deception insulting please tell anyone murdered people make people lose faith god really christians need elaborate lie maintain faith next brown going write novel robert langdon walks water give christians faith god hmm short found novel little shallow taste,True

I don't understand all the hype or the controversy. It was mildly entertaining, and the ""clue"" format was interesting, but it was nothing outstanding or deplorable in my eyes.

Robert Langdon is minding his own business when he is contacted by an official at CERN to come look at some evidence and a dead man. Nevermind that Langdon is a professor, not law enforcement, his expertise is needed. It looks to be the work of the Illuminati, a cult made of scientists who has a very big vendetta against the Catholic church. Can Langdon solve the Illuminati riddle in time? The very future of the Vatican depends on it.

The characters were mostly unbelievable in this. They had too many powers, too easily overcame obstacles, and apparently had super-human strength and healing properties. There is no way, after some of the things that Langdon went through, that he'd want to be walking let alone want to have sex (and that's all I'll say on that). Vittoria was a shallow character that seemed to be there in an attempt to have a ""strong"" female character. But she neither added much, nor was very strong on her own. She relied on Langdon's character quite a bit. And the character and personality changes in some of the others were hard to follow and made it seem as if they weren't even the same character at all.

If you ignored the poorly written characters, the plot was actually fast paced and kept your attention. There was always some kind of action or gruesome scene to read and the clues and mysteries kept the reader engaged. I also liked that the entire book took place in the space of a day, but didn't seem too rushed. It was an impressive way of writing the story. I can't comment on historical accuracies, etc. I know nothing about the Illuminati or Catholic church history, etc. I'm going to assume some is accurate and some is not, as seems to be the case with most fiction works.

Certainly entertaining but by no means a work of art. I'll read the next in the series just because it is a good way to spend a rainy weekend.

I liked the way the main characters were involved in a quest, searching for clues all around the Rome, finding old documents... I think this helped the tourism, also.

The fact that I like it does not mean that I believed the author's idea or anything. I doubt that he believes it himself. It's just fiction, but it's well written and it's entertaining. I also liked that it leaves room for debate and discussions, which I think a good book must do.

There were a lot of things that came to my mind while I was reading it, but I don't know if here is the right place for posting those opinions. The main idea is that I believe that religion and science are two parts of the same whole. We need both of them. Religion offer us moral guidance (or at least it should, because too often people are doing things in the name of religion that are contrary to that religion) and science helps us evolve.

― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons

Angels and Demons is Dan Browns first foray into the Mystery and Symbology adventure in which we follow Robert Langdon, a Harvard Educated Symbologist and expert in religious iconology, who finds himself pulled into the middle of an adventure which could have disastrous effects in the worlds of both Science and Religion.

Robert Langdon is a inspirational character. Well educated, well mannered and athletic providing a somewhat generic but enjoyable character who allows the story to be the focus rather than the character himself.

Angels and Demons is an exciting and fast paced adventure that seamlessly ties aspects of realistic history with fanciful creations. Exploring the division between Science and Religion in the search for faith in God we follow Robert Landon on an adventure throughout Rome and history itself.

Rereading Angels and Demons after many years it is much easier to understand the backlash that Browns books often receive for they are clearly very easy to consume adventures that if one was to look too deeply into the scientific, historical or geographical claims then the overall story could quickly fall apart. However, when read as a simple exciting fictional adventure the book becomes a delightful, easy to read journey. Aspects of the story are fairly predictable but the unexpected twists are what keep the story engaging.

Dan Brown has a masterful ability to move his characters through time and space with each piece of the puzzle aligning well and without confusion. I often found myself predicting an outcome, yet he has also a great ability to introduce a plot twist seamlessly, as with the miscalculation in the Pantheon. The material concerning historical facts and the layout, architecture, and art of Rome is well researched. There were several incorrect references to other religious material, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism (Brown should probably brush up on his Indian religion before including them with Western ideologies on account of the fundamental differences regarding the idea of God and the meaning of life). Overall, however, a very enjoyable read.

One thing that I found amazing was that the whole book all occurred within twenty-four hours. The main character, Langdon, returns with his amazing ability to solve puzzles that have been hidden for years extremely quickly.
Once again Brown has shown an incredible amount of knowledge and detail in the description of all the locations and sculptures.
I immediately took a liking to Vittora’s character as a strong, independent individual. She is portrayed as very clever and fit.
The story was really interesting and I was amazed by the ambigrams used throughout the book. I got hooked on the story and read over 200 pages in one evening, finishing the book by reading the aftermath the following morning. This is the first book in quite a while that has excited me so much that I have stayed up late to read more.
With many fully developed characters Brown does an amazing job of populating this story. You feel like you get to know a majority of the characters fairly well, aided by many flash backs to their past. Most of the supporting characters were fully fleshed out and not just added in to help the story along; they all had their own emotions and reasons for being there. At the same time Brown does a really good job of leading you to think a character is acting in a certain way, just to turn it all around and show that they are actually on the opposite side than you thought. In this way I was not surprised when
Spoiler
Kohler, an unusual but good guy, turned out to be working for the Illuminati; in fact I guessed this before it was revealed. I was however very surprised when in a final twist the conclusion revealed that Kohler had indeed been on the good side from the start and he revealed Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca as the real enemy. I was surprised by this final twist as Ventresca had been portrayed throughout the story as a lovely man, who was strong and smart. However, he went mad with a form of grief when he found out the Pope’s secret.
This book had me hooked right from the start and was just as good as The Da Vinci Code (as prequels have a tendency to be unable to match the wonder of the original book).

The story takes us through an exhilarating journey filled with frantic hunts through sealed crypts, dangerous mysteries, and the Illuminati lair. Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology professor, is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. The story takes up from there as Langdon joins forces with the enigmatic scientist Vittoria Vetra and discover unimaginable secrets.
The book was absolutely compelling to read for me. Every time the action picked up, I could feel my heart race, and my eyes, brains, mind... whatever, could not get enough of each line. The whole plot is very engrossing and gives an adrenaline rush throughout. Some may find Dan Brown's writing ""very unrealistic"" or ""unbelievable"" but I say it's all about the imagination. It should be. I suppose for readers who have a very active and wild imagination (like me) it's admittedly easier to find this novel (and his other books) enthralling. For me, his writing is dramatic. I mean dramatic in a good ""historical mystery-scientific facts"" kind of way (if such a thing even exists) and not the ""tragedy-romance-family"" kind of way.
Normally, books with short chapters irritate me because I am a person who craves more descriptive plots. However, Brown's books have to be the only exception for me where my mind crawls back for more. The fast-paced thriller makes it very enjoyable– you can feel the fulfillment through the small yet stimulating chapters. Similar to The Da Vinci Code (another bestseller of Dan Brown), the author bounces from one point of view to another without leaving the reader confused. Since I've been switching between classic - romances, and mystery - thrillers (because, why not?) lately, it's refreshing to read a thriller book with the story shown from different angles after reading a classic with one point of view. It brings me a sense of contentment as I watch the story unfold from all those angles.
If you're a ""no-nonsense"" person who's into serious and current affairs storylines, I'd advise against reading this book (along with Brown's other books) as there is a slight possibility that you may find it absurd halfway. Regardless, all I can say is that this book is an incredible piece of work and it's guaranteed you'll find it so if you're a fan of The Da Vinci Code. If you're searching for something to read that satisfies your imaginative brain, you should definitely check this book out.

This book sets scientific progress and religious faith/dogma in opposition, as they have been since Copernicus and Galileo dared to describe a galactic view different from that suggested by Catholic dogma. Science is the ultimate god because it is proven, say science's priests.

The counter argument, and it is legitimate, is that science runs so fast to discovery that it spends little time pondering morality (the Jurassic Park concept of ""can we"" vs ""should we""). Through a religious authority, the author reminds us that science promises answers and solutions, but instead always discovers only new questions; that there is no place for contemplation because scientific discovery is often about patents, applications, and profits (my words, not Brown's).

Members of my church that I have spoken to that have read this and The Da Vinci Code like Angels and Demons better, likely because of the sacred feminine concept.

- all this happened in 24 hours... Really? Good as they were they managed to research and crack codes in virtually no time at all.
- that flight over from USA to Swizterland in an hour... Really? (Coz I'm fairly sure the flight into Rome was nearly the same length, in the same plane).
- this book was written at the turn of the millennium, and if I'm reading correctly the nun and priest used artificial semination in the 1960s... Really? Were they even doing that then?
- the military took on a 16 year old for two years military service and trained him as a helicopter pilot... Really? Seams an unlikely waste of resources to me.
- Robert Langdon survived that helicopter fall and was able to get up and about nearly minutes after... Really? He was miles up in the air, with a scrap of fabric to break his fall and survived and antimatter explosion. Pushing the bounds of possibility somewhat in my humble opinion.

I read Da Vinci's Code when it came out and I really liked it - I couldn't stop turning the page. But with this book it took 3 months to get through it.

I will say that the ending was a huuuuuuuge disappointment because it veered so far from any plausible fictional reality that I could even accept it. I mean... I rolled my eyes a couple times (esp when the plan was revealed). It felt too preachy in areas and I felt it tried too hard.

I was not a fan of East vs West theme that played second fiddle to the Catholicism runs the world theme. Just, meh. It was annoying to read about this vengeful heathen, savage-like, evil Muslim that was too dumb to realize he was being used. The reiteration of those kinds of things were disgusting and orientalist. If you're looking for a pop-culture reference to how to pass Orientalism this would be an ok book to look at. Though the book focused on the fall of the church, it ingeniously brought the church as the main focus and continuously asserted it as the most important religion on earth. Vittoria was a hollow character to me as well. I felt she was included just so she could be the one female character in a book full of white men. And at that, near the end of the book she was repeatedly reduced down to a sexual symbol. In fact, almost all the characters including Langdon lack depth.

Furthermore, it was like a dummy's guide to reading a thriller. A lot of ""better stay tuned"" ""he would soon find out"" ""if they only knew"" type of sentences riddled throughout. I think the content is suspenseful enough and the overall story intriguing enough that a lay reader would bore through it. I did not have the patience for the mediocre quality of writing and found myself more distracted by the style than the story. I am glad I read it because now I can finally watch the movies.

Angels and Demons is a quick, exciting read, just like The Da Vinci Code. I finished it in a matter of hours and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Well. Most of it.

Apparently Robert Langdon is immortal, because he should have died about ten times during this book. Not only is his lung capacity approximately eight times the size of the average person (attributed, supposedly, to his swimming regimen), but he is able to withstand a freefall from a helicopter into the Tiber River (because, of course, he jumped with a blanket that acted as a parachute). Suffice it to say that there was an almost catastrophic eyeroll at my house when I read that section.

Other than that, there were some minor editing changes I would probably have made--adjectives, mainly; you can tell when somebody whipped out the thesaurus and chose the WRONG WORD--but I skipped past them after a while and focused on the good stuff.

So I started out my Dan Brown experience with the Da Vinci Code. Somehow I managed to make it through my reading life up until this past year under the impression that the Da Vinci Code was the first book in its series, Inferno was the sequel in this imaginary duology, and Angels and Demons was a completely unrelated book by Dan Brown. There's even and ENTIRE book I COMPLETELY MISSED! I AM SO ASHAMED OF MY IGNORANCE!!! If you have experienced this same struugle spurred by obnoxious media and crappy movie adatations, I'm here to help.

Robert Langdon Series:
1. Angels and Demons
2. Da Vinci Code
3. Lost Symbol
4. Inferno
5. Origin (release coming Oct 2017)

Luckily these books are quite able to stand on their own and, apart from a few little references to previous books (which don't affect the plot), the sequels do not rely on previous installments. I have been completely unable to find a copy of The Lost Symbol at any of the libraries in my county, so I have gone ahead and skipped it for now and started Inferno a couple days ago. I figure I already screwed up my order, so I might as well jack it up completely. Why not? Go big or go home, right?

Dan Brown is a phenominal writer, and he kept me riveted at moment. Like, seriously. EVERY. SINGLE. FREAKING. MOMENT. OF THIS 700+ PAGE BOOK. It's been a while since I've experienced that, especially with such a long novel. Angels and Demons is even better than Da Vinci Code in my opinion. From the exposition to the denoument, every piece of the story is tied together seamlessly. Characters are fully developed human beings with complex and even contradicting motives and back stories, just as screwed up as real human beings. Brown shows us both the best and the worst in each of his characters, then throws them together in the most intense 24 hours of their lives to discover their breaking points. His complexly woven plot points work together in a magnificently complementary manner, none overshadowing another, each playing the exact role it was intended.

In my opinion, the worldview expressed, i.e. the philosophical beliefs exposed by the main characters, cheapens what is otherwise a rich backdrop.

The beliefs of the Catholic Church (I’m not a Roman Catholic) are not well represented in the story, even by characters who are members of the church. The most poignant religious statements in the book promote either pantheism (God is in all things) or a secularized form of Christian spirituality. This latter spirituality, while found in many churches, does not represent Catholicism, nor biblical Christianity. If your own religious convictions are deeper than what is presented in popular press and media, the religious reductionism in this story is a little frustrating. Also annoying is the relentless assumption behind the story - that religion and science are enemies. This tiresome misnomer is rooted in a truncated understanding of the history of scientific philosophy and Christian theology.

Dan Brown not only wrote a good novel but he also brought up the old argument of Science vs. Religion. Both sides of the argument are thoughtfully brought up in Angels and Demons and in the end it is up to the reader to decide which side they believe is the right path for them. I love that he didn’t try and persuade the reader of his view on the subject but instead put the evidence and arguments out there for us to make up our own minds.

Review
I never read one of the Dan Brown books but decided to pick this one up to fill two of my challenges. One of the challenges was for a book bingo square *pick up a book everybody but you read* and the other challenge was for the big books. As I am a rigid series reader always wanting to start at the beginning I went with Angels and Demons and not The Da Vinci Code. Before picking up this book I was curious. I love mystery books where symbols laying out trails are used but I was not really attracted to the Illuminati and religious aspect of the book (the reason I had not picked it up before). While reading the book I did notice that it was indeed not gripping me as much as other books written in this concept. This does mean I have to applaud the writing style of Dan Brown because he did manage to pull me in and making me want to read the book.
The story starts out on an early morning in Roberts house where you get onto the roller coaster with him which brings him to Europe and pulls him into this mystery. Robert is described as a man who loves his job, teaching and puzzling with religious symbols. I had the feeling he is a friendly and calm man. This does come out later in the story if we see him trough the eyes of Vittoria. He was easy to connect with him and feel for him when he gets in difficult situations. The fiery Vittoria is a very strong female character, I did experience her as a bit cold and calculated in some situations which was usually explained with her experience in one or another research project. The interaction between the characters was great and I did like that despite the fact that they are both smart people they did not all of a sudden got smarter in the field of the other character.

The everlasting struggle between science and religion is despicated here in a beautiful mold of architecture heaven in the heart of Vatican city. Vatican City is what is what Mecca it is for us Muslim, the heart of Christianity, the tomb of St Peter th Rock, where Jesus decided to build his first Church. I loved this introduction to Christianity's history in a non-Christian book. I was always obsessed with the design and the architecture of churches all around the world, starting with a Cathedrale in my city, and after reading Angels & Demons, I'm more in love of the architcture.

Let get one thing clear, I'm an architecture hoe, I love love it! Since I was a kid, it was my dream job to design home and structures and I'm more attracture to Gothic and Renaissance architecture. Walking in Robert Langdon shoes all around Rome and Vatican city made me the happiest.

As you can see based on my pervious reviews of the adventures of Robert Langdon, when opening a Dan Brown book, I'm more in it for the descriptive style of his writing that give you a telescope look over the surrounding the characters; you get to see what the character sees, as if you're the one Walking along the cities and vaults and musuems and old shelves of restricted documents. So, if you're picking a book for the literature thrill, it may not be the book for you. Dan's style is more of a ""straight to the point"" with a strong grip of exciting and heart gripping drops and plots.

Reading the Robert Langdon's arc through Dan Brown out of order didn't actually affect me because each book is a stand alone, but it is a nother thrill to read them in the same order cause you get to see Robert Langdon maturing spirtually.

I've seen the movie adaptation years ago, before knowing who's Dan Brown is, so I know the plot and scattered images in my mind of Robert and Vittria running through Rome is surfacing now and them when reading the book. however, it didn't ruin the book for me, because it is a universal thing that books are way better than books, and I can still remember that the ending of the movie was different in a sense from the book.

As a Catholic I really enjoyed the book as it is FICTIOOOON!!!!! and I've been to Rome and seen most of the art he refers to.
It's a good fiction book with some very loose base in reality, and it can be enjoyed as such. (FACT: the ambigrams used in the book were made specifically for the novel by John Langdon)

I think the movie is better, because the movie is a little bit more realistic in terms of how the events would unfold and some heroic acts...for example: Langdon falling from the sky and surviving really? Not only surviving but making it near a hospital?

I think the point were the book lost its appeal to me was when it was declared that the Pope and the Camerlengo where related, I mean ok, I get that he needed some real profound event to make the Camerlengo flip out of his mind but couldnt he have found somethign else????

Also a point I do not like in the book is the death of Cardinal Baggia (in general that all the preferiti die...) I was actually waiting for one of them to survive but I guess in Dan Brown mind they all had to die for the message of the Camerlengo to be even more potent.

I have mixed feelings in general about the book. I like the premise and its a fun read with some fact input (very minimal) but the way he worked out some of the plot points seems bizarre (starting with the freaking plane and that they spent so much freaking time in the CERN labs, and moving to the whole Camerlengo reasoning for the master plan)

Compared to the DaVinci Code this one is lighter on art history and random facts, more complex plot points but in reality most of the basis. I don't recall much of the Da Vinci Code because its been awhile since I read it but his writing did improve a whole bunch over this one.

I will continue to read Brown's books because they are entertaining and you can read them relatively fast....

This is a pretty interesting read, though it gets a little boring at a few places. I must say that Dan Brown's talent of covering just a day (well, more or less a day) is really great. You also get to a lot about the Vatican City, its secret archives, its beautiful monuments - when it was built, who built it, what significance does it have, etc. It's a fast-paced book and we also get to know a lot about the clergy system of the Catholic Church in the Vatican City and in general.

The main antagonist of this book is the secret group - Illuminati. I had never heard of it until I read this book. After I got a basic idea about Illuminati, I become very interested in it. That is one of the good things about this book - The sub-plots, themes, general knowledge are presented in such a way that you get stuck to it.

Coming to the negatives of this book, the main problem is that it tends to get, especially towards the end, a bit too over-dramatic. You might like that kind to drama in movies or in plays, but in books, it seems a little unrealistic. Also, Brown says that anti-matter is the most powerful and destructive thing created by man, but scientists argue that it's not as dangerous as it's mentioned in the book, in fact, it's hardly more dangerous than a cracker. As a reader, I would just request you to neglect some inaccuracies and, accepting the fact that it is fiction, just enjoy the book.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is 13+.

Dan Brown is incredible at creating a fast-paced while still multi-layered thriller that at the same has the spectacle and religious esotericism as an Indiana Jones film. (Robert Langdon is effectively Indiana Jones without the aesthetic) The religious and artistic history entranced me like hypnosis—Christians stole the practice of “god-eating” from the Aztecs after conquering their empire. Some of the plot points seemed a little unnecessary though—why does Robert go into the helicopter? I did the love the fast pace but slow burn of the reveals, like the dead Pope actually being the camerlengo’s father and not just his foster father, and the camerlengo’s reveal as Janus. Vittoria and Robert are a cute couple, and they are definitely a good match—she’s determined and flexible (literally and figuratively) and he’s quiet and compassionate. The scientific theory, though advanced, is clearly and concisely explained to the non-scientific mind. The backstories (for Langdon and Vittoria especially) are incredibly compelling, like how Vittoria came to meet and grow up with the man that would adopt her. The Hassassin’s deadly inspiration and glorious delight in his cruelty weave a spell-binding villain. But the one of the most significant elements of the story is the fact that you can truly walk this Path of Illumination—from “Habakkuk and the Angel” in the Chigi Chapel in the cathedral of Santa Maria del Popolo (Earth—Terra) to the “West Ponente” relief in St. Peter’s Square (Air—Aria) to “The Ecstasy of St. Teresa” in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria (Fire—Fuòco) to the Fountain of the Four Rivers in front of the church of Saint Agnes in Agony in the Piazza Navona (Water—Acqua) and finally to the Church of Illumination within Castel Sant’Angelo.

Angels and Demons was a fine enough read, definitely wasn't as pulling for me as I was hoping. I didn't love that the villain of the first three-quarters of the story was a stereotype, and I also disliked the insta-love between Langdon and Vitoria. 

What I did like about the story was how Langdon just seemed to be Some Guy for the first two and a half hours of the audiobook--he had no idea why he was there an neither did anyone else; he was just the first person they found who was a professor of religion when they googled it, which I find so funny. He was basically useless for three hours and just acted as a walking purse for Vitoria. I thought it was hilarious.

I also think a lot of male authors try to make good female characters and fail horribly. Dan Brown, however, seemed like he was trying to make a cookie-cutter female support character and accidentally made a pretty cool woman. I really liked Vitoria. Again, thought her relationship with Langdon was pretty rushed and didn't feel right, but I liked their friendship, it was fun. Plus, their final interaction where Vitoria said Langdon only wasn't religious because he hadn't let her fuck him yet was. Pretty great, I'm not going to lie. It was fun.

The things it did right!
- The plot was amazing and it kept me guessing. I have been having some issues with thrillers recently where I am able to guess the entire plot of the book from the first 50 pages which ruins the fun for me. I love guessing about the plot. I don't like too many hints and I don't like to be blindsided with something that doesn't make sense. This plot, however, was immaculate. Each twist felt organic and unexpected, red herrings were expertly placed and the pace was just perfect.
-The setting was so good. The book takes place in CERN and The Vatican/Rome so its backdrop was fantastic. Felt like I was taking a small holiday when I picked up this book.

Things it got wrong!
-The characterisation of the Hassassin. This character was one of the only two PoC in the book. From the 'middle east', this character wanted to 1. rape women and 2. do terrorism. I think this was a dangerous stereotype that should not be perpetuated in the media. What was even more telling is that this character was a supposed employee of the illuminati which was against all organised religion, yet this character was angry at Christians for the Crusades against Muslims? All in all this character could have been so much better. The twist at the end of the novel when the whole plot comes together also just adds more confusion onto him. He is a supposedly highly trained assassin yet there is no explanation about his backstory at all.
-The forced romance. I just did not like the romance between the two characters. 1. The age gap was unclear but it still made me feel icky and 2. it added absolutely nothing to the book and the end scene was just cringy. (and the MULTIPLE times she takes a gun out of his pocket)

In conclusion
A good read for those who want a stunning plot and a thriller that keeps you guessing. It is well researched and the setting is great. It does have some problematic aspects surrounding characterisation such as making a believable romance and the Hassassin was just a bad character in all aspects but it was a great read otherwise.

Other than that, though, I was unimpressed. Dan Brown's writing style was a bit too simplistic for my taste. (Not the plot, just the writing style.)

Brown’s writing I found was easily readable and I also really enjoyed the short chapters. When reading a book with shorter chapters, I feel I am making faster progress in the book and I am more inclined to continue reading if I can get through six or more chapters in 45 minutes. I also really enjoyed the pacing of the book, I still read a lot of young adult (YA) novels, which I would say are paced faster than adult books and I felt right at home with Brown’s pacing.

Brown seems to be a master storyteller as the elements of his story are polished, I feel he has well written and developed characters, the plot of the book is one that entices the reader, the setting is taboo as Vatican City is a very holy place and the events taking place are anything but. Robert Langdon is a great protagonist, reading his arc from Harvard professor to “hero” was fantastic! I also thoroughly enjoyed the many plot twists throughout the novel. At times I was questioning things as if I knew something might happen and other times I was completely surprised when a plot twist would occur. This book has the things I look for in what I consider a “good book,” it had action, adventure, romance, suspense, humor and it taught me something. I love reading books that are fictional and yet I learn interesting things in the process. I have always been fascinated with history, especially things that aren’t in textbooks like the Illuminati and even history surrounding the church.

This book may not be for everyone as there is much controversy surrounding Brown’s works, especially his most infamous ‘The DaVinci Code.’ Brown is mixing science and religion, two things that are fundamental opposites. The mixture of these two things does not sit well with some, but while there may be some detest for Brown’s books, there is also an audience for his books. I found his book to be a great mix of thrill and thought, a combination that I have gravitated towards for as long as I can remember.

What they don't realize is this journey to the Vatican City to save her canister of 'antimatter' and the preferiti from the hands of the Illuminati is one that teaches them both about the Catholic Church during the 1700s during the time of Galileo, Bernini, and Michelangelo.
While this both takes jibs at the church's and science's destructive past to move forward to the 21st century, this novel also lightens to the theme that one can not live with out the other. Science can not be hypothesized, observed, and deduced without the inspiration of the wonder of God's creation. Science does nothing but prove the majesty of healing, creation and evolution, reproduction, destruction, and adapting to our world.

I find it strange that this really made me question my belief in God, and the place religion has in the world, far more than Life of Pi did which was advertised as a story that 'will make you believe in God'.
I absolutely loved all the historical references, but then again that is coming from the art-culture geek within me. Strangely enough one of my favorite characters was the Camerlengo, despite the way it turned out.

I found myself mystified by the symbolisms, science, and the histories of various subjects that had been explained and these elements were the main reason I forced myself to finish the book.

The characters were dry and two-dimensional. They had little personality and I personally wasn't invested in them nor could I spot a character arc as to me, they seemed to remain the same from beginning to end. The plot was nice but sometimes, the twists felt a little unnecessary and the romance sub-plot even more so. I liked the way the author wrote the villain of the series but the ending seemed a little rushed to me.

That is not the order the movies were made in, ah, Hollywood. In Angels and Demons we meet Robert Langdon, the symbologist who will become the main character in Brown's next 5 books. Symbologist, cryptographer.....Dan Brown can make the oddest job titles out to be sexy! Robert Langdon is asked by a Swiss research facility to investigate a symbol burned into the body of a murdered physicist. The symbol belongs to a secret organization called the Illuminati. The Illuminati has historically been known to contain many famous members as well as a hatred for the Catholic Church. As the Vatican prepares to select a new Pope, the Illuminati announces that they have planted a bomb within the Vatican City. Can Langdon follow the clues and save the conclave before the bomb detonates?

Grammar - 5
One thing you can count on with a Dan Brown book is the amazing writing and editing.

Plot - 4.5
The topic was very interesting. It is a fast paced thriller. Brown takes the reader on a thrilling ride that contains just enough ""on the edge of your seat"" tension to keep the reader engaged.

Believability - 4.5
Brown does extensive research. I am not Catholic but have enough understanding of conclaves and the Vatican City to find the background of the story believable. The one funny point that holds me back from a perfect score is the main character. Don't get me wrong, I love Robert Langdon, he is very likable. I sometimes can't mentally get past a college professor who's topic of interest is symbology as someone who dodge's bullets and catches bad guys.

Ending - 4.5
The story had closure. Even though this is a series each book in the series could be read as a stand alone. The one constant between the books is the main character even though he tends to have a new, female sidekick in each book. One benefit of reading the books in order is that you do get to know Robert Langdon's eccentricities, such as his fear of tight spaces, but if the personality quirk is important to the story line Brown makes sure to point it out.

Price Value - 4
When Brown's books initially come out they tend to be more on the higher end of the cost scale. Angels and Demons has come down a couple of dollars in cost but unless you catch a good deal, or find a used copy in a bookstore, or wait another 20 years I don't think it will drop in value a whole lot.

Though he'll never win any awards for his writing, he somehow digs up the dirt on some really cool historical events and people. His second novel mimics his later The Da Vinci Code. Instead of Christianity, it's the Vatican City and the Catholic Church under fire here. There's even an Hassassin who is the mirror image of Silas. And Langdon runs around Rome finding clues from historical works of art, mostly that of Bernini.
So, what happens in the novel? CERN has discovered how to create antimatter. A capsule of this is stolen by the Illuminati and stashed it somewhere below the Vatican City as a time bomb. The Illuminati is a real underground group that rose from the rank of scientists like Galileo when they couldn't stand the atrocities of the Church against science. After hundreds of years, they're now back for revenge. The Pope has just died and the cardinals are gathered in the Vatican to elect the next one. The Illuminati has captured their 4 popular candidates and will be murdering them one an hour at some of Rome's historical locations. It's up to symbologist Langdon and his CERN researcher Vittoria to stop the murders and defuse the bomb in time.
The ambigrams are a cool addition to the book. Just like in The Da Vinci Code, Langdon will suddenly stop at critical junctures and start spouting historical trivia.

This book is what I would call historical fiction because it uses history to create a present day fictional story. One thing that I do find rather interesting is how well Dan Brown has depicted the extent that the church will go to cover up their damning past.

Recently we have heard in the news about the current Pope being a Nazi child soldier and the church did not hide the fact that they were trying to change historical documents to have this negative part of the Pope's life edited to something more fitting to what the Catholic church stands for.

Without spoiling anything, Dan Brown did an excellent job in creating a fast paced, high octane story that shows the lengths the church will go to and the cover ups they have committed, which leaves the reader wondering what else are they hiding?

Dan Brown does how ever go slighly overboard when discribing the Vatican's Vault and the technologies within it. This could be because he was refused access to do research and had to guess or because he was trying to prove that the church is in fact NOT caring for these sacred documents in a special way like what he puts in the book.

Regardless of the facts not all being truly factual he did hit the nail on the head with this work. Leaving you questioning history, science, the future and how it will all mesh together.

There was only one thing keeping this from being a really great book: the author. The story grabs you early on with a ticking bomb somewhere in the Vatican and a gruesome death and then proceeds to send you on what should have been a non-stop ride to save four kidnapped Cardinals, save the Vatican from the bomb, and rescue the girl. Unfortunately, there were stops along the way, and the further along you got, the more stops there were.

As I said, the biggest problem with the story was the author. Too many times he had characters repeating what they or another character had said as recently as five sentences before. There were far too many contradictions, such as one character saying he was a Catholic priest, so he didn't need to be told about the Illuminati, then three sentences later saying he wasn't familiar with something about them. There were statements that were patently untrue, such as a centuries-old ""demon hole"" that was still so full of vapors from rotting corpses that it made it dificult to breathe. There were complete failures of imagination on the author's part, such as an escape from a locked room that was ripped straight out of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" And, worst of all, there were far too many instances, especially in the last 20% of the book, of downright improbabilities.

I'm not a huge fan of action books or movies where everything is centered around villains and violence, but all the nerdy stuff in this book surely made up for it :)

On the other hand, I really dislike Brown's way of writing characters, everything from creating backstories interesting enough to describing them in present day and action. I mean, of course Robert Langdon is as perfect as Brown's wanted him to be (bet he created him as a perfect version of his own self), but oh god, ARE THERE MORE TO FEMALE CHARACTERS THAN THEIR BODIES? Obviously there should be, but I wouldn't recommend using Brown's books as a guide to writing women. Or, tbh, any other characters either, so very one-dimensional, stereotypical, (and even racist) he made them all (apart from Langdon ofc). Especially the assassin — his actions and overall villain-ness didn't frustrate me nowhere near as his personality was written to be.

So, overall the story was adventurous and entertaining if you just treat most of the chacters as ""necessary implementers to the required actions"" and ignore their personal traits.

Hello, Dan Brown.  This is my first book from him.  Of course I've heard of him, and The Da Vinci Code many times.

However, however, I finally bought it last week because it was on sale for half price.

It's not a disappointment at all!

Our story follows Robert Langdon who...miraculously goes on a rollercoaster journey in just a day.  I'm not joking.  He flew from US to Switzerland, then back and forth between Vatican City and Rome.

Things I Liked About It 

- fast-paced 

Since the book is a one-day story, it's on a tight schedule from the very first page.

- adventures 

The actions.  The thrill.  Countdown every hour ain't something relaxing.

- conspiracies

Who is behind this whole thing?  Is it this man?  Is it that one?  You'll be surprised by every revelation.

Things I Disliked About It 

- ???

Well...how could all of this happen in just a day?  I'd definitely have a heart attack first.

Quotes I'd Like To Share 

*

""He's a little well dressed to be playing Spiderman if you ask me.""


*

""Sometimes, divine revelation simply means adjusting your brain to hear what your heart already knows.""


Recommendation

You should pick it up if you

- like Italian.  There are quite a few Italian words and sentences.

- are interesting in electing Pope thing 

- has a big of interest in scientific stuff.  Ex: matter, antimatter

- can't commit to big books

Robert Langdon is a professor of symbology at Harvard University and he is suddenly called in to investigate a mysterious murder that seems to have been committed by a defunct anti-religious order called, you guessed it, the Illuminati. When a dangerous substance is discovered to be stolen from CERN (yes, the CERN) he joins forces with murdered scientist’s daughter Vittoria Vetra to save Vatican City from a deadly explosion.

Brown manages to write a thriller that is both exciting and historical. As a history buff I appreciated all the details Brown included. I was also inspired to delve more deeply into the history of the Illuminati (they were actually a pretty cool group, but I still roll my eyes at the conspiracy theorists of today.) I thought I had it all figured out about halfway through the book and was ready to call this book predictable, but the continual twists at the end definitely threw me.

I’m completely in love with Vittoria Vetra. She is an amazingly strong female character. She’s smart, sassy and she doesn’t let the pretentious Robert or any of the other men in the book (because except for one other character, all the major characters are men) beat her down. She does it without coming across as a men-hater too.

I do have one complaint though. (Thought you were going to get through this without one didn’t you? Sorry, no tamale.) And this is a pretty big spoiler. Why did Robert and Vittoria have to get together at the end? Why do authors insist on putting together the two lead characters? Honestly, I couldn’t see either of them in a relationship with each other. Their personalities are just not compatible. Even though I (almost immediately) knew they would end up a couple, I kept hoping and praying they wouldn’t. Why can’t they just be bros?

And on another note (and again, spoiler alert, also this might get a little PG-13) why is it always that when a female character is in danger, or kidnapped or whatever, that the first thing an author turns to is rape? It makes me extremely uncomfortable reading about a rape, or even an attempted/hypothetical rape. There are so many more creative and less disturbing ways to torture someone, but because it’s a woman, it’s always rape.

But despite those facts, I thought this was a good book. A perfect mix between history and thriller with a fairly unique ending.

I mean, am I really adding anything to the conversation? Especially with hyped books, it seems pointless. So maybe this should be considered a rant...I just need to get the disappointment off my chest.

I was into this book for a while. The plot had me interested, I loved the fast pace, it was fun. Then the closer I got to the end, the more the fun lessened and my irritation grew. By the time I got to the last line, I was just pissed off and left with a bad taste in my mouth.

Vittoria. Why are you in this book? Nevermind, silly question. You are in this book because every ""hero"" (term used lightly) needs something sexy to look at. It's not like Robert Langdon could have just gone to Vatican City to do what he was sent for, he must have a beautiful woman to ""save"" in the process. Pretty much every time Vittoria is part of the story, it is simply to point out that she is a woman and nice to look at. However, she really isn't even a woman in the novel, she is simply an object. Something that Langdon uses to feel masculine, youthful, and heroic.
Spoiler
In the end she is nothing but, as the Hassassin indicates earlier, a reward for a man.

Also, there were many parts of the book where I was wondering why Langdon even needed to be in the story.
Spoiler
Like why did you get in the helicopter, Langdon? You were unnecessary, the camerlengo could have dropped the canister himself. Oh yes, someone had to be a witness for the ""big reveal"" later. There were many points when it seemed he just accidentally fell into this story. Like how did this bumbling dullard end up in this exciting plot? Most problems seemed to get conveniently solved without much help from him. The story could have been better coming from another perspective, Chartrand perhaps?

Spoiler
Also, we're not going to talk about how they are planning to keep the final events of the story a secret in the end? Just going to let the Vatican come up smelling like roses? The stamp as a gift from the Pope, more like a bribe.

The first section can be summed up in ""Science is Magic. Religion is Sacred. Murder is Special. Scientists lack Basic Logic Skills. Science puts a finger in the Christian God's eye."" Why did they call up the protagonist for the problem? Because, that's why.

I love a good code deciphering, treasure hunt-like mystery novel. I devour them like how a glutton would a buffet of great tasting foods. Angels & Demons is one of the toe curling, truly engaging, and highly controversial mystery novel out there.

When the movie [b:The Da Vinci Code|968|The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)|Dan Brown|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1303252999s/968.jpg|2982101] - based on a book of the same title, came out in 2006 one of my friend and I got curious and wanted to read the book. That's when we found out that it is actually from a series and that it's the second book already. At first I thought A&D was the second book since TDVC was more popular and was made into a movie first.

Both The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were almost banned in my country because of the Catholic Church's protest. Before you can watch or buy the book, you have to be 18+. Which sucks for my friend and I because we don't look near 18 that time. Oh, the struggles we went through just to buy the books from NBS and the ninja moves we did just to enter a cinema to watch the movies.

The religious people around me sneers whenever they saw me read a book made by Dan Brown. Some of my friends had a hard time reading A&D because they thought the book was against Catholics and the Church or that it contains Catholic bashing statements. If you are sensitive when it comes to subjects like this and find it hard to read books depicting the 'dark past' of the church (even if the book is FICTION) then, I guess, you need to stay away from this book.

Amidst the controversies and adamant refusal of our school librarian I still enjoyed reading A&D. It was an engaging read and the plot is very interesting. I mean the topic of Religion and Science put together will always be a hot and sensitive topic. The discussion that commenced between my friends back in 2006 because of this book was fascinating to watch. This book is thought provoking and if you don't know the history of the Catholic church you will easily find yourself lost between what is fiction and what is fact.

A summery for Angels & Demons:

When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol—seared into the chest of a murdered physicist—he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati...the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy—the Catholic Church.

Langdon’s worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the ’s holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival.

Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair...a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation.

- it’s also so so amazing in that it achieved exactly what it endeavored to achieve and left no crumbs behind. the build up was amazing and the conclusion was marvelous
- i’m also glad i read this right after a semester where i had an art class. it made me appreciate the first half of the story more.

- as a student in university studying to be part of the academe, i thought it was odd that the characters (especially in the beginning of the novel) have a very odd perspective/approaches to newfound knowledge. they’re skeptical but not open-minded. they have this parochial point of view that just doesn’t exist if you’re a scholar.
- i wish i’d read this before studying the philosophy of science. but you just can’t circumscribe the transcendental to the limitations of science. science is empirical and therefore requires perceivable proof, but our perception of reality is drastically limited to our five senses, so i don’t agree that science is the answer to understanding God. there are some statements i agreed with (i honestly agreed with a lot of the chamberlain’s points in his monologue and victoria’s points about God when she was arguing with the chamberlain) but this would spur a lot of debate

So, I'm highly disappointed by this book. I loved Da Vinci Code because I learned a lot of things. This is mainly why I want to read this series. Dan Brown is passionate about history so I want him to tell stories, to explain symbols, secret societies etc. In this book we learn about Illuminati and about Vatican and how a new pope is elected but that's it. We spent half of the book just to arrive in Rome and for the plot and chase to begin. The actual chase happened so fast, we barely learned something.
The plot made absolutely no sense. I really don't understand what was the purpose of it (don't wanna spoil). The ending was completely far-fetched and made no sense at all.
I won't even speak about wrong historical and geographical facts which is disappointing from someone who's supposed to love history.

Then we have a chapter in which we go back in time and she is ""saved"" by her father who adopts her. There are some attempts by the author to balance the good with the bad, as she is written as a skilled and intelligent woman. But she is framed mostly as the love interest of our comfortably-bachelor protagonist, and the attention called to her body, while not the worst I've ever read, is definitely intended for cishetmale readers.

I don't read a lot of mystery or thrillers so it's not really a suprise, but I really didn't see this ending coming. So many twist and turns! Another great part of this story was the setting. The description of Rome, the churches and the art was done so well. It almost felt like I was there, racing against the clock, with Langdon and Vittoria. I also really liked the characters. Even though there were so many 'just on time' moments which normally is so unrealistic that wasn't the case in this book.

I went into this trying to put aside any of my preconceived notions about Dan Brown and his writing. You guys... I really wanted to like this book.

First, what I liked: the story was entertaining! The action was exciting, and the fast pace of it really kept my attention on what was happening.

Now, what I didn't like: most everything else.

The writing left a lot to be desired; a more notable quote being ""Houdini did yoga""... this was said by the female character, Vittoria, after what could've been an impressive feat. But, having her say that after what doing something impressive made it seem really trivial and silly. Speaking of Vittoria, I don't think Dan Brown has ever met or spoken to a woman. She was written so badly. Everything she did was amazing, for a woman. She's supposed to be this really smart scientist, yet for some reason Robert Langdon is always completely surprised when she comes up with a good idea.

Another thing that got to me, and I'm not sure if it's due to the book being 20 years old or if it's just me, but the Illuminati was a major thing in the book and I just could not take it seriously. The Illuminati is just sort of a joke for me, and it was just very odd seeing these people's reactions to it in the book. They had either never heard of it somehow, or they only knew if it from a popular video game. On a similar note, it was also odd to me that no one had heard of anti-matter either. Like I can understand not knowing exactly what it is, but these educated people had never even heard of it. How??

My last gripe is the whole thing with the ambigrams. An ambigram is a word, art form or other symbolic representation whose elements retain meaning when viewed or interpreted from a different direction, perspective, or orientation. This book made it seem like making an ambigram out of the world ""Illuminati"", and a few other words is like humanly impossible. If you went to pretty much any tattoo shop they could probably make one for you in like an hour... they're not that hard Robert Langdon.

So yeah... overall enjoyed the story but had a lot of issues with the writing.

Everything about the plot of this book is ridiculous, particularly the hoops that characters jump through to avoid taking obvious steps like reporting a murder to the police or evacuating a location threatened by a bomb.

Some of the nonsensical behavior by various characters gets explained away through a succession of plot twists, but there is still more than enough nonsense to go around.

What does work is the pacing, which is spectacular (and also ridiculous, but in a good way). All 620 pages of action take place in the space of about 24 hours and span four countries (admittedly one is Vatican City, but I am still impressed with this).

Protagonists Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra are fun, heroic types. The main villain for most of the story is something of a cardboard cutout. Some (threatened, mostly) sexual violence feels like lazy writing.

The supporting cast has some more interesting characters, although it takes a while for their complexities to emerge.

The ending is what pro wrestling fans would call ""overbooked"", with plot twist on top of plot twist in such rapid succession that most of the scant remaining shreds of credibility are swept away.

What I enjoy about Brown is how he can write almost 600 pages of a book and I get almost to the end and realize that it has taken place all in the space of one day. As a writer, I would love to be able to do that. The weaving of religious and scientific themes into an adventure set in European locales is also right up my alley.

What I don't like... and why I am forced to drop down to two stars (just a few examples):

That same time stretching often results in a parceling of time that is terribly irritating - most of the book actually isn't just in less than one day but in about four to five hours. Unfortunately, in one part of the book, given twenty minutes, the protagonists can, say, drink tea and eat scones, talk at length about their theories about what's happening, run from one location to another, save someone, and research an important historical fact. But during another twenty minutes, they don't seem to have enough time to, say, run the length of a block and enter a building. It must be difficult as an author to keep track of this sort of incongruity but this is Brown's special trick and it's irritating that he can't follow his own rules. It needs to be either one way or the other but not both.

Every few chapters, he seems to feel the need to reintroduce his main protagonist by first and last name, ""Robert Langdon stood in front of the church...""; like we haven't met this character yet for every single paragraph for the last 126 chapters (and no, I'm not exaggerating on the numbers of chapters).

This really, really frustrating thing where the protagonist, Langdon, is this brainy professor that can supposedly figure out these relatively obscure, secret messages hidden by other brainy men hundreds of years ago in order to save the world... and yet he can't figure out the REALLY obvious things right in front of his face. I was listening to this on audiobook and I SWEAR, I kept expecting a three year old child to pipe up from somewhere in the back of the crowd, saying, ""Oh, come on, mister! You can't see that? Seriously? Aren't you supposed to be the hero? Even I can see that!!

And, finally, lines like, ""The silence that followed might as well have been thunder."" Um, what... honestly, what? Is this Brown's version of ""A thunderous silence followed...""?

It's really rather frustrating because I honestly think that in many ways Brown is rather talented; in some of his plotting, the details, the ideas he pulls together. I just wish that in other ways - the writing, some characterization, he could catch up with his other abilities.

After reading The Da Vinci Code, I was going to read both this and Digital Fortress but I do believe I will stop here... wishing I could tip it over to the three stars.",Neutral,Positive,honestly want give book three stars enjoy brown write almost pages book get almost end realize taken place space one day writer would love able weaving religious scientific themes adventure set european locales also right alley like forced drop two stars examples time stretching often results parceling time terribly irritating book actually less one day four five hours unfortunately one part book given twenty minutes protagonists say drink tea eat scones talk length theories happening run one location another save someone research important historical fact another twenty minutes seem enough time say run length block enter building must difficult author keep track sort incongruity brown special trick irritating ca follow rules needs either one way every chapters seems feel need reintroduce main protagonist first last name robert langdon stood front church like met character yet every single paragraph last chapters exaggerating numbers chapters really really frustrating thing protagonist langdon brainy professor supposedly figure relatively obscure secret messages hidden brainy men hundreds years ago order save world yet ca figure really obvious things right front face listening audiobook swear kept expecting three year old child pipe somewhere back crowd saying oh come mister ca see seriously supposed hero even see finally lines like silence followed might well thunder um honestly brown version thunderous silence followed really rather frustrating honestly think many ways brown rather talented plotting details ideas pulls together wish ways writing characterization could catch abilities reading da vinci code going read digital fortress believe stop wishing could tip three stars,True

""Angels and Demons"" begins with a gruesome murder of a physicist at CERN. The victim is also branded with a mysterious yet symmetrical brand, ""Illuminati"". Along with Langdon, we learn about a certain deadly technology, now being used to endanger the Vatican.

At the Vatican, Robert and Vittoria (physicist's daughter) realize a bigger conspiracy involving the Pope, the select Cardinals, and the deadly technology. Murders are about to be committed and there is limited time. While Langdon tries to discover the locations of the murders, he's unknowingly put on the Path of Illumination. Each destination demands a description of its ancient architecture and the hidden, subtle Illuminati symbols. Alas, at every step, we witness a murder so gruesome yet so symbolic that it sends chills up the spine.

Throughout the book, I felt a certain sense of attachment to this particular character (no, it's not Robert Langdon). Every time he suffered or was at unease, it pained me. Towards the end, when I guessed what this character was about to do (at least what I felt he would do) left me speechless. But man, I was wrong!! Having read Da Vinci Code, I could not understand how or why Dan Brown was placing the church in a good light. How mistaken I was!

While the plot, in general, was decent, the ending was what changed it for me. If I'm not reaching, I'd say the who or what the end result is, is symmetrically opposite (or a negative) of what one would guess initially (XD). But what made me give this 4 stars instead of 5 is the formula plot. Those who have read The Da Vinci Code know every character is formulaic, churned out to play set roles across his book series.

Reading through the Dan Brown Robert Langdon novels is part of trash girl summer and let me tell you as someone who's halfway through Da Vinci Code as well: this man is a genius. He reskinned the book and doubled his profit!

Angels and Demons features relatively the same cast as its more famous sequel - a young woman (who's often pointed out to be attractive AND attracted to the self insert protag), who's personally involved in the case due to the loss of a father figure. She's at once brilliant (because obviously Harris-tweed Langdon is a man of taste) but also asks the dumbest questions imaginable to spell things out for the reader. There's an entire scene in the middle where Vittoria literally just parrots the last thing that Langdon says as a question so that he's not monologuing through the solution to a puzzle. There's the stern law enforcement who Langdon, through different manufactured circumstances, has an adversarial relationship against which he has to demonstrate his genius. I'm going to assume that Da Vinci Code is going to end in a lot of red herrings and macguffins for the mystery of it all.

Here's the premise: Harvard Professor Robert Langdon is called to investigate a murder in Switzerland because the director googled ""illuminati"" and he came up, so that's a hilarious and flimsy start. Through this, he goes on a relatively interesting hunt for a killer who is staging elaborate murders throughout Rome at sites of artistic importance, with the Vatican under the thread of destruction all the while should he fail. The athletic feats that are demanded from this 40 year old Harvard professor whose exercise routine consists of swimming, is a bit of a stretch, as is his recovery time at the end when, yes, it does feature the worst last line in the world: ""You've never been to bed with a yoga master, have you?"" This is after what is essentially Brown's 10 chapter soliloquy on the relationship of science and religion, proof and faith. There are interesting ideas there and like I said, the elemental based hunt was actually pretty fun, but you really gotta just empty your brain out a little bit and not ask too many questions.

Brown has all the subtlety of a sequin covered hammer belting out show tunes in the middle of traffic, but that's likely his appeal. You can honestly get on a flight, sit back, and let him take you on a tour of the greatest hits in Italian art. The way he focuses on and writes certain characters is akin to a freeze frame in a movie with a voiceover saying ""hey, pay attention to this detail"" and it all ends in a kind of hilariously melodramatic way that doesn't quite vibe with the rest of the book. The antagonist's motivation and backstory becomes almost a soap opera. It does hook you, even when you scoff at poor decisions made and you have to pause and remember when the book was written due to the incongruence in available technology, but it's fiiine. I have a feeling it's likely the best one out of the bunch..",Negative,Positive,honestly fun summer read require lot brain power reading dan brown robert langdon novels part trash girl summer let tell someone halfway da vinci code well man genius reskinned book doubled profit angels demons features relatively cast famous sequel young woman often pointed attractive attracted self insert protag personally involved case due loss father figure brilliant obviously langdon man taste also asks dumbest questions imaginable spell things reader entire scene middle vittoria literally parrots last thing langdon says question monologuing solution puzzle stern law enforcement langdon different manufactured circumstances adversarial relationship demonstrate genius going assume da vinci code going end lot red herrings macguffins mystery premise harvard professor robert langdon called investigate murder switzerland director googled illuminati came hilarious flimsy start goes relatively interesting hunt killer staging elaborate murders throughout rome sites artistic importance vatican thread destruction fail athletic feats demanded year old harvard professor whose exercise routine consists swimming bit stretch recovery time end yes feature worst last line world never bed yoga master essentially brown chapter soliloquy relationship science religion proof faith interesting ideas like said elemental based hunt actually pretty fun really got ta empty brain little bit ask many questions brown subtlety sequin covered hammer belting show tunes middle traffic likely appeal honestly get flight sit back let take tour greatest hits italian art way focuses writes certain characters akin freeze frame movie voiceover saying hey pay attention detail ends kind hilariously melodramatic way quite vibe rest book antagonist motivation backstory becomes almost soap opera hook even scoff poor decisions made pause remember book written due incongruence available technology fiiine feeling likely best one bunch,True

I decided it was about time to check them out myself. Angels and Demons, the first of the Robert Langdon series, is a book I may never forget. It may be a thriller full of historical facts, but in order to enjoy it, you have to employ one of the key tenents of the science fiction and fantasy genres: a suspension of disbelief. This whole book from start to finish is so utterly ludicrous that if you don't step back and remind yourself that this is a work of fiction, you won't be able to finish it. Somehow, Dan Brown continues to shock you over and over again with how off the wall this book gets as you go along. In fact, this book is so off the wall, it isn't even in the same room anymore let alone still in the same house! I've never read anything that goes off into the deep end like this, especially in the last 100 pages or so. I totally understand where people are coming from when they say that Dan Brown is the master of the ""cheese factor"".

Yet, for how crazy this story is and how un-killable Robert Langdon is, this book was really fun to read. I found myself just tearing through this book, looking for the next insane twist and unsolvable conundrum. With just how much fun I had, I would rate this higher, but in good conscience, I cannot ignore the lunacy of the plot.

Also, as a side note, why did Dan Brown have to claim that all of his facts (and there are many) are true? It just challenges you to look up all of his claims and it makes him look bad when you find something he was wrong on. Furthermore, this claim feels strange in the parts where he mixes historical fact and historical fiction.

You are the Director of CERN, and one of your senior colleagues is killed in his room with a peculiar word branded on his chest. Do you:
1) inform the authorities
2) google the word branded on the dead man's chest and then phone the first Harvard professor whose name appears in the search results
3) have a nice cup of tea?

You are the head of the Swiss Guard, responsible for the security of the Vatican during the conclave which will elect the next Pope. You receive reliable information that an explosive of unimaginable power has been hidden somewhere in the Vatican and will detonate in a few hours. Incidentally, four senior cardinals have also disappeared. Do you:
1) evacuate everyone, including the cardinals and most of the population of Rome
2) lock the cardinals into the Sistine Chapel and hope that the explosive device will be found by the Harvard professor and the cute physicist who have just turned up
3) have a nice cup of tea?

What was the fate of Copernicus?
1) executed by the church for heresy
2) died in his bed after a lifetime as a priest and senior government official in a church-run statelet

Okay, so this is going to be a short review because I'd forgotten to review this book as soon as I'd finished it and therefore don't have the best memory of the events that occurred within its pages.

This book's strong point is definitely the plot. Dan Brown manages to create one of the most creative and intriguing plots I've ever come across. With a combination of riddles, history, science, religion and of course the Illuminati, I doubt Angels and Demons' will fail to please anyone. The story is carefully written and efficiently planned, allowing it to successfully deliver plot-twists where they are least expected and create tension and suspense faultlessly. +2 stars

The setting is also a major contribution to the book. Rome seems to fit in seamlessly with the rest of the storyline while simultaneously complimenting it. Having just have visited Rome before reading the novel, I loved being able to revisit the places I'd gone and to learn more about them. Brown's vivid descriptions make it easy to immerse yourself into the Roman streets and the majestic interior of the Vatican. +1 star

The fault in this book was found in the characters and their relationships with one another. Let me just begin by pointing out how irrefutably bland Robert Langdon is. I mean, sure, he's a professor at Harvard and everything, but that's about all the background we get. Other than that, all we know are the things he's studied and his thoughts towards the current situation. We don't know anything else about him at all. Something I find incredibly frustrating, given that he is our protagonist and especially since it is the same with every other character in the book. As for relationships and connections, Robert's relationship with Vittoria was incredibly forced and seemed to lack every bit of chemistry needed.

Overall, this book was an enjoyable read given the intriguing plot, yet the characters lack foundation and are incredibly bland. So if you're the type of person that doesn't care too much about how well you know the protagonist and the other characters in the book, this one's for you.",Positive,Positive,enjoyable read challenges beliefs okay going short review forgotten review book soon finished therefore best memory events occurred within pages book strong point definitely plot dan brown manages create one creative intriguing plots ever come across combination riddles history science religion course illuminati doubt angels demons fail please anyone story carefully written efficiently planned allowing successfully deliver least expected create tension suspense faultlessly stars setting also major contribution book rome seems fit seamlessly rest storyline simultaneously complimenting visited rome reading novel loved able revisit places gone learn brown vivid descriptions make easy immerse roman streets majestic interior vatican star fault book found characters relationships one another let begin pointing irrefutably bland robert langdon mean sure professor harvard everything background get know things studied thoughts towards current situation know anything else something find incredibly frustrating given protagonist especially since every character book relationships connections robert relationship vittoria incredibly forced seemed lack every bit chemistry needed overall book enjoyable read given intriguing plot yet characters lack foundation incredibly bland type person care much well know protagonist characters book one,True

This book talks about the basic elements and questions that one always ponders over, ""where did we come from? Does there exist an energy or supreme power called God?""

I'm in awe of the book. I would first want to come to the negative aspect of it: 1. There was too much unwanted description of fights between the Hassassin and Robert Langdon and 2. There was too much complicated physics stuff in the starting chapters which made no difference as all I need to understand was that there was a canister which contained antimatter, that was stolen and could destroy the entire Vatican City. And honestly, the only complaints that I have with this book and oh also, Vittoria seemed to be asking too many questions.

My favorite character irrespective of what he did and at what had been revealed that the end, was Carlo - the chamberlain. He was a man, who thought that he was doing the right thing and to an extent he wasn't completely wrong but the methods he used were completely wrong. I love how Dan Brown introduces a grey area and puts you on a difficult condition where you wonder if the person had been correct or wrong? when Carlo first broadcasted through the BBC in Sistine Chapel, with the speech about science and religion - introducing the fact that science may event but it is religion that gives you the implications and consequences and most importantly, morality. That speech won me over through and through. And although at the end when he did turn out to be the Pope's miraculous son, it made me tear up a bit. It was amazing how this story was woven and I loved it.

In comparison to the Da Vinci, this book wasn't that page turning. Da Vinci was a lot of page turning and entertainment and controversy. This book is a lot more about knowledge and insight. It makes you ponder over your basic beliefs and morals. And also, that I found Sophie Neveu much better of a character than Vittoria Vetra. Vittoria was fierce but Sophie was firm and I prefer firm over fierce. I also liked Robert's chemistry with Sophie better than that of Vittoria although there was more romantic scenes of Robert and Vittoria than of Robert and Sophie.

All in all, it makes you wonder. And it makes me believe that there is a power and there is an energy and a force that created us and that we call God or Allah or Jesus. And truly, science and religion are only two ways to the same truth. They are only two different perspectives of looking at the truth. In science, we go into variables and in religion we go into myths. Religion, I believe is a way, almost like policing our moralities.

From the start of the novel to the very end, this book was undoubtedly a page-turner. There were so many aspects that kept on on the edge of my seat: the thrill of the chase, the conspiracy theory, the ongoing struggle between science and religion, the historical fact-finding, and the unexpected and mind-boggling plot twists. There was never a dull moment in this book. It was was a fairly sizeable volume, but it was so engrossing that time seems to fly by. I am aware, but not intimately knowledgeable, of the controversies surrounding this book; however, since I'm not a field expert on the topics surrounding this book, the entertainment factor was retained throughout my reading experience.

Nothing excites me more than a character who was thrust outside his comfort zone and ultimately excel. I also love his female sidekick, Vittoria. She kind of remind me of a kick ass, female version of Watson to Langdon's Sherlock. Together, they make an unstoppable team. The only problem I had with this book was the ending;

Wow, Dan Brown's writing sure is clunky. His dialogue never seems realistic, the Italian he throws in is awkwardly placed (and sometimes inaccurate), and his dramatic foreshadowing or mood-setting language is often laughable (one notable instance: he provides a dramatic description of the Hassassin's familial and cultural history early in the book. This includes the hitman description, etc. Then Brown spells out that the term hassassin morphed into assassin. Do you really think we need it spelled out?!). Had I had anything else to read, I would have dropped this book in the first 200 or so pages. The second third, however, becomes interesting. I have to give Brown that: I was curious enough that I kept reading. Then, however, it starts to drag in the final third of the book. I got stuck somewhere around the final branding. The poor writing and terrible characterization began to take their toll and I started to skim rather than read. Why didn't Brown's agent or editor insist that he shorten the book? Surely he could've chopped 100 or so pages?

Next complaint: Brown can't create a good, believable character. Robert Langdon is clearly Brown's fantasy version of himself: a well-respected academic who is in fantastic shape and is attractive in a Harrison-Ford-as-Indiana-Jones kind of way. Vittoria is a sexy, fiery Italian physicist. The Hassassin is a bizarre stereotypical bad guy, whose interests are: killing people, sadism, and revenge against the Catholic Church for the crusades (this is all clear early on, so I'm not marking it as a spoiler). No further characterization.

Now the issues with the plot...
First off: I'm an ex-Catholic. As such, one of the major plot points has a glaring catechismal error that I can't ignore: Spoilerthe Catholic church doesn't condone artificial insemination. Artificial insemination is considered ""playing God""/infringing upon the sanctity of life and is therefore not allowed. I can't believe someone who would be made Pope would accept AI - the papacy has been incredibly conservative, and the conservative wing of the church has consolidated power post-Vatican II to prevent further modernization.. 

Beyond this, there are so many bizarre plot-holes and factual errors, which many others have listed, that make the book a bit hard to enjoy. I don't expect my movies or books to be entirely accurate.

Nothing captured human interest like human tragedy

3.75 stars!

I'm a bit torn over this book. I loved loved loved this book, until 60 pages from the ending. The ending just completely ruined my enjoyment of it.
Spoiler
the fact that the camerlengo was the mastermind behind this whole plot I can't deal with, even if I saw it coming from a mile away. What also bothered the hell out of me was the fact that the fathered a child through articifical insemnation. It's just ridiculous to me. And you're telling me that the camerlengo did all of this on his own?? the whole plot? except for the Hassassin? give me a damn break. You're telling me that this one man decided after the pope fathered a child, that he would give people their fate back by planting a bomb in the Vatican and making himself out to be a savior. Ugh. I also really disliked that the main bad guy/killer/Hassassin was Middle-Eastern. You couldn't find an atheist bad guy willing to kill people that was Caucasian? Anyway.

Except for the ending, I really enjoyed reading Angels & Demons. The chase through Rome, the history and the buildings. The whole Illuminati plot was well done in my opinion, even though it bothered me a little that in the beginning of the book he says that the brotherhood of the Illuminati is factual. (they stopped existing in 1785, the whole Illuminati thing now has nothing to do with the original and very true brotherhood then).
I annotated this book like I have never done before. Seeing what was factual and what was made up by the author was a lot of fun.
Spoiler
For example: in the book Vittoria says that Raphael was moved to the Pantheon centuries after he died. Not true at all, he was buried there immediately per his request, and his request was granted because he was so well known. I don't think I ever wrote this much in a book in my life.

I read the Da Vinci Code first. And I loved the hell out of that book too. So much so that I can't say which I liked more. I was a little skeptical at the beginning of this book because both start off exactly the same: Robert flies off to a foreign country due to the discovery of a dead body. He is introduced to the victim's daughter, who he works alongside for the night and winds up bedding after all is said and done.

The start of Angels & Demons was a little slow for my liking. I think it took over a hundred pages before the chase even began, what with Robert being introduced to Kohler and Vittoria. And within those hundred or so pages, there was so much information to take in that it was sort of baffling. We learn about CERN (and if you're like me and science isn't your strong point, it becomes a little blurry at times) and the Illuminati. After Robert enters Vatican City, the pacing was more to my liking. It's quick enough that I wasn't bored at all, but it still offers so much information and detail along with such a heavy plot. The characters are suddenly running around like mad trying to save lives and catch the Illuminati, and it becomes extremely captivating. It was hard to put it down for the middle section of the book.

Even the ending has a really surprising plot twist. I was waiting for Kohler to get involved again, but not nearly in the way that he was. This book obviously deals heavily with religion, but I think the main reason it was bearable to me is because Brown gives us the science vs religion battle (and even science WITH religion as a possibility) without shoving either opinion down the reader's throat. The only problems I really had with this book wer the length (570 pages seems ludicrous, but then you sort of get sucked into it and want to keep reading it forever) and the similarity to the Da Vinci Code.

So when I heard that Angels 7 Demons was coming out, I decided to read the book before I saw the movie- that would be a great motivating factor...however, when I went and saw the movie on a whim, my plan was ruined. Once again, I loved the movie, but when I tried to read the book, it kind of failed.


For once, I really think the movies were far better than the book (I say ""book"" as I still haven't gotten around to reading Da Vinci). Angels & Demons is by no means a bad book, but the mood of the movie is really what won me over. The excessive focus on the ""mood"" totally worked in the movie for me, but trying to read it...it just feels as though he's grasping at straws to try to milk out a few more pages. The movie had beautiful cinematography, plus, the book is lacking the accompaniment by Mr. Hans Zimmer- which I found greatly took away from my enjoyment while reading.

I know, I know, I'm really behind the times here. I don't know why but I guess I just never found the time to read Dan Brown or didn't seem interested in it. I remember looking at this book and [b:The Da Vinci Code|968|The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)|Dan Brown|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1303252999s/968.jpg|2982101] when my mom was reading them when I was little and I guess I just put them in the back of my mind as books that wouldn't appeal to me because my mom and I don't have the same taste in books. At least, that's what it was when I was younger because my obsession with Harry Potter was too great that any other adult book seemed super boring.

Whatever. Off subject. The point is, I FINALLY got my hands on a copy of this book and sat down and read it and WOW. I'm blown away with how great this was. I honestly thought I had the book figured out and knew who it was going to be in the end, but then I was wayyy wrong. I can honestly say I never saw that coming and I LOVE that in a book.

**Spoiler starts here

First off, I just want to say hats off to Dan Brown because anyone that can squeeze out 500 pages with a time span of about 24 hours, with a majority of the novel happening in just 4 hours, more power to you. All hail the mighty pen you wrote that with, because that's just plain impressive. And it was never repetitive or boring or seemed like there was an overwhelming amount of detail that took away from the brilliance of the book. The pace was great even though it might seem like it would be slow because it takes 500 pages to cover just a few short hours, whereas most books have a long period of time in 300 pages. So that was genius in itself.

The entire plot was just amazing. I can't stop raving at how smart it was. The writing was crisp and entertaining but overall, it was just an intelligent book. It really made me think and I honestly appreciated all the historical facts in there, whether they were true or not. Even if they weren't, it all made logical sense the way he wrote it. I love when you can fit things into concrete history--like an entire secret society conspiracy--and it actually works in the context you've given it. You have to do a lot of research to make those things seem historically accurate even when they're not, and I appreciate the knowledge that was had to be able to write this book. It was very detailed and in depth and incredibly well thought out.

The characters were great and real too. I never once doubted their actions or thought they were behaving out of line. There was some character development, which I think is hard to do considering they only were in the novel for a few hours and you can't really change who you are, but they all behaved consistently. Once again, things just made sense.

Let's talk about a plot twist! I was convinced from about 100 pages in that Max Kohler was behind everything and was almost kind of disappointed when it all pointed to him when he went to talk to the camerlengo. For as well written as the entire book was, I didn't want it to end so predictably in the sense that I was suspicious of this character the whole time and then oh, it's him, no surprise there. Then all of a sudden it took a turn and I was definitely not ready for the camerlengo to be behind it all. If anything, I thought Mortati was going to be it, even though he was locked in with all the cardinals and would not be able to communicate with the press or anyone. I was kind of glad that he was the Devil's Advocate because I didn't want to be completely wrong in my instincts that there was something different about him. But damn, really did not see that coming at all.

My only complaint about the book is the ending. Brown kind of skimmed over how the camerlengo and Langdon survived the helicopter. He had Langdon's fall described in detail, but I'm pretty damn skeptical that he would survive that. There's just no way you can hit the water from that height and live. It would be like smacking into concrete, even if he was trying to slow down with the makeshift parachute. That was one of the only unrealistic moments in the book. And it never quite explained how the camerlengo survived the helicopter and antimatter either, so that whole section right there just didn't really add up for me.

http://ibeeeg.blogspot.com/2009/06/angels-demons-by-dan-brown.html

Angels & Demons poses many theological and scientific questions. A war between science and religion. There were so many questions, so many facts (art history, tombs, tunnels, architecture in Rome) along with Illuminati - did it really exist??? How about the Catholic Church - the politics, the pope election...fact? Hmmm...my brain is spinning, trying to make sense, trying to understand. There is a huge part of me that is cringing.

Why cringe? I cringe whenever I read something that seems to try and portray us humans (science, what ever) as more powerful and knowledgeable than God. I hold a great respect for the institution of religion...of the Catholic Church. However, I am not so naive to know that the Catholic Church at one point was very powerful in the world of politics, history, the building of nations, the downfall of individuals who want to speak out for their faith that was different from the Catholics. Regardless, the core is that they do believe in Christ Jesus as our Savior so I do have a respect.

I did, however, find the story interesting. I found myself caught up in the intrigue, the mystery, the action. I found that I read this book at a slower pace than usual as I needed time to process the story - the information. The beginning, due to huge amount of information was a bit slow but around pg 236 I found that my heart started to pound. The story became intense.

After what seemed like a thousand years, I finally finished this book. (Blame the bad old slumps!)
I'd say generally it was good. Aside from a similar plot structure, I liked the history behind the events.
It certainly was interesting reading about the Illuminati, and I am glad that it was a fast-paced book.

""Full"" review :P
Having loved The Da Vinci Code, needless to say, I did have quite an expectation for this book. It did not disappoint to the extreme point, yet it wasn't good enough in comparison. I feel like that the basic plot progression can be quite similar to the others in the series, but I guess I'll make a final decision on that after I read Origin.

As usual, I was so baffled by the amazing mystery/puzzle solving skills of Robert Langdon. It was so satisfying to see problems coming to a solution. In addition, I was able to grab some quick facts along the way, which was a big bonus for me. All this in a book? Oh boy, I was intrigued. (Psst, if there's any more of these books that you know of, do recommend them to me! I am definitely in to read them)

Another part that I did enjoy about this book is that how it talked about the mixture of science and religion. Being able to read about history was a big reason why I liked The Da Vinci Code, so the reason also applied to this book.

Like I stated before, the reason for a 3.75 rating rather than a 4 or above is that the plot was somehow too expectable.

ehh...this was a bit of a disappointment. The concept was extremely interesting - the possibility of intimate connections between religion and science, and what happens when they become adversaries - and through the first three quarters the story held incredible promise. Then, it all sort of...fell apart. The story should have ended much sooner than it actually did, and the level of ridiculousness that it reached was worthy of one of Jack Bauer's most frenzied episodes. Finally, many of the plot ""twists"" were thoroughly predictable - I saw them coming for miles. For a more enjoyable, less ridiculous caper, I think Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code would win in a competition.

Somehow I missed this series when it first became popular. I got [b:The Da Vinci Code|968|The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)|Dan Brown|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1303252999s/968.jpg|2982101] then I found it was not the first in the series. But Angels and Demons got pushed to the bottom of my list, and then I forgot about for a few years. So I just now got around to reading it.

Angels and Demons was a very fast-paced thriller. It was an exciting combination of conspiracy theory, European history, religion versus science, and good ole get-the-bad-guy action. Since I am not a historian, theologian, or Italian, I do not know how accurate the details of the book are. To the untrained eye, it seems there was enough research done to make a believable back story.

It was nice to have a slightly nerdy underdog for a hero. Langdon's primary weapon was his mind and his extensive knowledge base on symbology and history. He is also an accomplished swimmer which keeps the character from falling into the stereotype of all brains and no brawn.

I liked that there was a strong female lead as well. Although, Vittoria Vetra falls into the sexy scientist category. While I liked her character in the beginning, she felt flatter as the story went on. She went from the intelligent scientist to side kick to damsel in distress. I wish she had more character development even though she wasn't the main character.

It is a little dizzying to look back and realize that the entire book takes place over a twenty-four hour period. My head would probably pop if I went through that many traumatic/suspenseful events in such a short time. Yet Brown makes it work. At times it feels like there is an almost unbelievable amount of events crammed into one book/one day.

There did seem to be a substantial number of chapters. With 137 chapters, this has to be one of the highest amount of chapters I have seen in a novel. Each chapter only a few pages and most of them end with mini cliffhangers. Normally, I don't get very absorbed in books with multiple points of view. But it was surprisingly easily to follow even with the constant switching. And there was almost no down time so I never got bored. It was definitely a page-turner. No, the writing was not very descriptive, but the story was good. I can see why it is such a popular series.

Spoiler
I did get annoyed that they find three of the four Cardinals alive yet are unable to save them. Having finished, I understand that saving any of them would have ruined the big reveal at the ending. But it was frustrating for them to be on time yet still to late to say them.

There wasn’t as much history as I would’ve liked. In his other books, he delves deeper into unknown history, this was seemingly pretty predictable. It should be noted that this was his FIRST book with this character & has definitely crafted the character & plots in more recent iterations.

There wasn’t much of a surprise factor, but either way, Robert Langdon is a great character.

I have never read a Dan Brown book before so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I am so glad I read this book and I can honestly say this book has changed my life.

It has just opened my mind not only to culture and art, I have learnt more about that on this book than in any one lesson at school, but it has expanded my mind and completely changed the way I view religion. I'm not a very religious person, I will say that I believe in God or a higher power but I have never believed in following his rules and I hardly ever pray or go to church. I believed (and to a certain extent still do believe) that people who are too religious are ignorant to science and fact and that so many of the worlds problems, war, terrorism...etc are created by religious leaders who cause destruction and horror supposedly in the name of god. I have blamed religion for a lot of the worlds problems.

But this book made me a lot more open minded and just overall more accepting. I think the people who do those things are psychopaths in the disguise of a holy man. They use God has an excuse to cause pain.

The writing at the beginning was complicated and since I don't have a great vocabulary, I often had to pause to look up the meaning of a word but as I went on I completely forgot about the plot and I just wanted to keep reading. It's not till the very very end that everything gets sorted out, and even when you think everything is alright the biggest twist on them all takes place.

I was satisfied with the ending but I can see why some people may not have been. I too wished that the world found out the truth but I think that in the end it really was for the greater good. The threat was done and people were united and happy and in the end you have to consider what really matters. Justice for the dead or peace for the living?

I can't wait to read the rest of these books Robert Langdon is a great character and I have heard great things about the Di Vinci Code",Positive,Positive,going post completely non spoiler review beautiful twists story want miss never read dan brown book sure expect glad read book honestly say book changed life opened mind culture art learnt book one lesson school expanded mind completely changed way view religion religious person say believe god higher power never believed following rules hardly ever pray go church believed certain extent still believe people religious ignorant science fact many worlds problems war terrorism etc created religious leaders cause destruction horror supposedly name god blamed religion lot worlds problems book made lot open minded overall accepting think people things psychopaths disguise holy man use god excuse cause pain writing beginning complicated since great vocabulary often pause look meaning word went completely forgot plot wanted keep reading till end everything gets sorted even think everything alright biggest twist takes place satisfied ending see people may wished world found truth think end really greater good threat done people united happy end consider really matters justice dead peace living ca wait read rest books robert langdon great character heard great things di vinci code,True
874,https://app.thestorygraph.com/book_reviews/4d0ec247-c054-4e6e-ad15-459003b999c3,5.0,"I'm really sad to have waited over two months to review this book, but at least I'm doing it now! This is the first of four books in the Robert Langdon series. At the end of the review, I will compare the book to the movie adaptation.
This is so cool after finishing the book and going back to review it: the ""Angels and Demons"" blank page is written as an anagram!

The prologue describes a man (we learn is Leonardo Vetra) being tortured for a password and then branded. The story starts with Robert Langdon receiving a series of phone calls from Maximilian Kohler for him to come meet with him immediately. He knows about his book, ""The Art of The Illuminati"" and claims to have gotten his phone number from his website, which Robert doesn't think he put there. Because it's 5:00 in the morning, he refuses Kohler's offer. As he thinks to himself, we learn that he is a professor of symbology at Harvard and likes to swim laps there. Soon after the call, Langdon is faxed a picture of the Illuminati anagram (you can read it upside down identically) and a dead man.
After some more talking with Kohler, Robert goes to the Boston airport, expecting an hour flight, but he is surprised to see a rocket-like object to take him to Geneva, Switzerland (not in Geneva, NY like he thought)... it apparently flies and does it really quickly.
The POV switches to a killer talking on the phone with Janus and sounds really creepy. I was thinking (it mentions this in the book, too) about the greek god Janus, the two-faced man... kind-of foreshadowing after looking back on it. They occasionally switch back to him, doing some pretty weird stuff.
When Langdon lands, he reaches CERN, a European nuclear research group. Maximilian Kohler is an old man that zooms up in a wheelchair to meet him... we are inclined to have a bad feeling about this man, and the fact that he could be Mr. Curtain's twin (LOL (from Mysterious Benedict Society)) made me super suspicious that he was a really bad guy. As they're walking through the halls, Langdon realizes that it's a really serious/studious place but all of the young people there throwing frisbees with various college sweatshirts made it seem like a university... there's even a plaque stating that they invented the worldwide web. Some of the sentences in this book cracked me up, ""'I see,' Langdon said, not seeing at all.""
Kohler seems kind of obsessed with disproving religion... he makes a whole ""speech"" about how science is the answer to everything and stuff...
It turns out that Leonardo Vetra was the man who was killed. Kohler didn't call the police and has only notified Vittoria, Leonardo's daughter. He says that the used a freezing system to preserve the body... this really makes you think that this dude killed him.
Then, Langdon explains who the Illuminati really are (* to * is the story of the Illuminati, disregarding the plot of this book)...

*They were a group of scientists (Illuminati = ""the enlightened ones"") in the 1500s who were on the quest for scientific truth. Many of the followers wanted to violently rise against the church, but their main leader was a pacifist and didn't want to cause any problems (Galileo), because he was a devoted catholic as well. He claimed that science and the church were allies... cold and hot were like heaven and the other place... but the church didn't want to be friends. After Galileo was put under house arrest for heresy, the Illuminati rebelled but four members were captured and didn't say a thing, even after being tortured and branded with a cross. They burned them after brutally murdering them, showing the people of Rome to not mess with the church and not to join the Illuminati. Then, the group went into hiding and re-emerged as a violent, anti-Christian group, because they tortured some of their members, and the church started calling them, Shaitan (Satan in Islam (a language they didn't like)). The Illuminati went from being a group of scientists to an anti-Christian, secretive cult. When the group fled Rome, they were taken in by the Freemasons, a secretive society of stone craftsmen. They weren't violent either, but when they were joined by the Illuminati, they were seen just as evil. Because they had infiltrated the Masons, they then were connected to George Washington and Benjamin Franklin (unaware of the Illuminati connection) and started banks and got other businesses to finance their ultimate quest: the creation of a secular ""New World Order"" based on scientific enlightenment. They called it their Luciferian Doctrine, who they thought was intended to represent its Latin meaning (bringer of light), or Illuminator.*

Langdon thinks that the Illuminati are very likely not around anymore, that some other group probably just took their symbols/brands to use, and that the Illuminati wouldn't kill a fellow scientist anyway. Then, Maxilimilian shows Langdon Vetra's office and explains that he was also a Catholic priest, which now makes sense for him to have been killed. The man was trying to prove that science and God were linked... the particles in every person are connected by a force, and it apparently is ""better evidence of God than religion itself."" They go back to look at his body, and Langdon is shown that his eye was removed, but Robert thinks that this is random murder, which isn't like the Illuminati at all.
Then, Vittoria arrives (Italian and pretty) and Langdon seems to like her. She doesn't want anyone to look in the lab anymore, because what they were working on was private between her and her dad. CERN apparently has their own particle accelerator (throwback to eight grade science), which is about sixteen miles long. A camera was also stolen and moved somewhere in CERN (signal still working). We learn about Vittoria's past... she was adopted by her father at a Catholic home, and they loved talking about science with each other.
At the door to Leonardo's lab, Vittoria opens the door with her eye (retina scan)... she is the only one besides her father who can open it. Kohler didn't know that they changed the lock, and Langdon is glad that she didn't see the dried blood. She explains that her dad was trying to prove how the universe started.. basically, he created matter out of nothing (anti-matter), proving science and religion. It is in a container, suspended by a magnetic field on either side of the canister, but if it comes in contact with matter (EX: the side of the canister), then it would explode and bad stuff would happen. If it is removed from its charger, then it only has a 24 hour life.
They didn't tell CERN about their experiment, because they thought the board would misinterpret its purpose. Their biggest specimen of antimatter (1/4 gram) is stored in the bedrock storage room, and they just wanted to keep a good sized sample safe.
The go down to the HAZ-MAT chamber, and the sample is gone, and an eyeball is left. I realized that the epitome of the enemy of the Illuminati is the leader of the Catholic church... the pope at the Vatican. Vittoria tries to call Interpol even though Kohler doesn't want her to (risk CERN's reputation), but she wants the professionals to help... sadly, her phone isn't getting service down there.
There is another lady in Kohler's office, but she can't reach him (no internet connection where he is), so she just makes an announcement. Kohler starts having some kind of breathing problem when they get back to internet range, and he tells them to go to the Vatican to get the canister. They're in the plane, and Langdon shows her some Illuminati symbology on the dollar bill""

*the pyramid represents a delta (science), and the eye above it represents how the Illuminati watches all things. In latin, the phrase below it says, ""New World Order,"" contradicting ""In God We Trust"" beside it. VP Henry Wallance probably told F. Roosevelt that it meant, ""New Deal,"" but then Roosevelt was also a Mason.*

Random: Robert's watch is a Mickey Mouse to remind him to be young at heart. When they're flying above the Vatican, Langdon thinks about how it's 15 days after the pope died, so all of the cardinals are in the one place to have a meeting, which has never been interrupted.
They meet with Olivetti, who clearly doesn't like them, and they show the camera filming the canister somewhere unknown in the Vatican. They have under an hour until conclave starts and until midnight for the battery to run out on the canister... how dramatic. The Swiss Guard (protects the Vatican) basically refuses to do a formal search for the canister.
They go up to talk to the Carlemengo. They get a call from a mystery man who says that besides the fact that they're going to level Vatican City by midnight, they have the four missing, favorite cardinals. One of them is the favorite (perforate), Cardinal Baggia, to become the pope, so they really want to find them. Because the church branded four Illuminati scientists, they will publicly brand and murder the four cardinals every hour until midnight. POV switches to Cardinal Mortati, who is leading the conclave, and they're nervous about the missing cardinals.
The Carlemengo doesn't want them to free the cardinals and that they should just start Conclave. Robert has been trying to get access to these archives for years, and he thinks the answer is there, so he heads down after being granted access by the Carlemengo (starting to like him a lot).
Robert and Vittoria look for a book by Galileo and ""the sign"" to the Church of Illumination in it. The path of Illumination was for the followers that came to Rome to be able to find the church... like a treasure hunt. They used religious sculptures to mark it so that the church would never suspect it (even though it was Galileo's Illuminati... nicer than current one)... they looked religious but really represented one of the four elements: earth, air fire, and water. Four cardinals, four symbols on the path... they will publicly execute each one at each marker.
POV switches to the Carlemengo Carlo Vantresca reminiscing about his mother's death in some kind of explosion of a church (he was the only survivor.
POV switches to Gunther Glick on pope watch at the Vatican with Chinita videoing. They get a call from an Arabian man (we assume the killer from before) telling him about where to go to get the best footage for something special.
POV switches to Robert and Vittoria in the archives, and the Illuminati ""special number"" is 503... they start talking about one of Galileo's books that was secretly popular (maybe how the word got out about the path of Illumination). It was printed on paper that would dissolve in water to protect the followers, book ""Diagramma"". Roman numeral for 503 is DIII, so they're looking for the book in special spots where the Vatican may have put it, and only 8% humidity in the new room. They find it and start looking for writings about math (universal language... Illuminati may easily understand it). On page five, there's a footnote (five = pentagrams... Illuminati), ""The path of light is laid, the sacred test."" They find four lines around the page, a poem by John Milton. Langdon wants to copy the lines down (and was careful to use gloves, tongs, and a spatula), but Vittoria just plucks the paper withe her gloved hands and rushes out. Part of the poem said, ""Santi's tomb,"" so Robert thinks that it's Raphael's tomb (Raphael Santi), which is at the Pantheon.
They are driven there by Olivetti and the rest of the Swiss guard, act as newlywed tourists, and are followed around by a fact-filled history geek. Vittoria goes and looks at the tomb, but the date when his body was placed there was a century after the Diagramma was published, so they realize that they're at the wrong place. After lots of talking and help from the geeky dude, the deduce that it must be a church that Raphael designed, Capella della Terra (""earth""... I knew that from French) AKA Chigi Chapel.
When they get there and walk around and talk a bunch, they realize that there's a mosaic on the floor and a spot like a manhole has a cover to the side and smells really bad. Langdon climbs down a ladder on the side of the pit... the man is buried waist-deep in dirt and probably died from his mouth being stuffed with more earth. In addition, the ""Earth"" ambigram is branded on his chest.
They figure out that Catholic favorite Bernini actually laid out the path of Illumination and designed things within the Vatican. The last line of the poem from the Diagramma said to follow the angel on the quest, and the statue of an angel is pointing one way, so they figure out churches in the line of the pointing finger and sculptures by Bernini.
They realize that it must be in St. Peter's Square, a public place with a sculpture depicting the breath of God (air). I was thinking about Greek mythology... earth is like Gaea, the earth mother, and her son is Kronos, the dad of the ""Big Three..."" Zeus could be air, Poseidon could be water, and Hades could be fire. Meanwhile, Glick and his partner are working on getting footage of the body and are now following the Swiss Guard's cars.
Apparently, a man was ""helping"" the old man, but they realize now that he had killed the man (the cardinal). His lungs were punctured, too, when they tried CPR. Gunther's camerawoman got it all on tape and ran off. They catch up to her, but Gunther slips the footage out of her pocket, but no one else sees him preserve it.
They go back to the Vatican to wash up, but they're having a hard time thinking of anything in the line that has to do with fire or even obelisks. Everyone is shocked by the footage and information that BBC is sharing, and they want Captain Rocher to keep looking for antimatter and want the Conclave to evacuate (Carlemango refuses). Gunther announces (probably all information from their call with the killer) that the pope was killed by Heparin and didn't die in his sleep, and the Carlemengo says that he got a daily injection. It is often mistaken for a stroke, but a way to tell (according to Vittoria, who looks at this in sea mammals) is if they have a black mouth inside. Robert goes back down to the archives to look for a list of Bernini's works. Meanwhile, there have been two failed votes for pope, probably because they're waiting to see if the rest of the cardinals survive. Kohler reads Vittoria's journal and examines the office. Vittoria learns that the Carlemengo was the adopted son of the late pope and was in the military for two years.
In the archives, Robert is trapped, because someone had turned off the power (the door is all automatic). Vittoria, Carlemengo, and some of the Swiss Guard are going down to look at the pope... you're not supposed to touch the body or perform an autopsy after, but when they look at his tongue, it's black (= overdose of his injection).
In the archives, Langdon is loosing air and is rocking back and forth to knock over the bookshelves and smash the glass, and he's really mad when he finally gets to reach Olivetti with his walkie-talkie. Max calls Vittoria, and he claims that her father did tell someone about the antimatter, even though they swore to never tell anyone.
Janus and the killer talk, and he wants Langdon and Vittoria to be eliminated, but he thinks about kidnapping her... Meanwhile, the Swiss Guard and others are on their way to Plaza Barberini for the ""fire."" The church is apparently under construction, but a woman saw an Arab go inside, and they see fire glowing inside. Langdon tries to get the man suspended above the fire down, but he can't and he falls in, branded. The assassin takes Vittoria, and Langdon hies under an overturned coffin, and he sets an alarm with his watch that saves his life.
Back at the Vatican, the Carlemengo says that he gives in to science, and he makes a huge speech about how religion lives on. Meanwhile, the assassin has taken Vittoria to a secret place, and Robert is still trapped.
They've agreed that if the church is still in peril at 11:15, then they will evacuate the cardinals with dignity into the streets. POV back to Langdon with the firefighters who rescued him... they give him a map, and he realizes that the three spots make a triangle, and a fourth could make a diamond (Illuminati diamond was kind of oblong and they loved the symmetry). He realizes that it's at the Fountain of the Four Rivers, but his walkie talkie doesn't connect...
He's nervous and kind-of goes crazy and holds his gun up to a man in a sedan and takes his car... I was like whoa there can't you just ask for a ride with the firefighters??
Anyway, about 15 minutes before 11:00, a black van without any headlights on drives up to the fountain. He has Cardinal Baggia tied up with heavy chains, and they talk a little bit before the assassin makes the point that it isn't a Hollywood movie where they talk it out before killing each other (LOL thank you for someone saying it), and that Vittoria is at the Church of Illumination. Langdon shoots the assassin's toe after he pushes the cardinal in, and they start bloodily fighting in the water. The cardinal is too heavy for Langdon, and then the assassin fights him... the cardinal sinks and dies, but Langdon gets a hold of a rubber bubble maker for some air... noice. Langdon swims laps and can hold his breath, so when he fakes his death, the assassin drives away and Langdon cries after five minutes of failed CPR attempts on Baggia. After getting out of the fountain, Robert sees a dove (symbolizing an enlightened soul), and he knows to go to the Castle of the Angel based on where it's pointing.
Robert meets an Australian guy with a TV truck at the building who says that a black van has been going in and out all night (wow he's a SMART one... wouldn't he think about what's going on and try to get footage??). Anyway, Langdon trades him information about what happened and where to find Baggia in exchange to climb up his $200,000 ladder attatched to the car. On his way rushing through the building, Robert sees jail cells and black robes where they must have held the cardinals.
He reaches Vittoria and the assassin, and he sees a pentagon-shaped box with the five brands and a square spot, empty, for the sixth brand. The assassin says that the brand is waiting for the ultimate target, and Robert thinks it's the Carlemengo (I was thinking either him or the dead pope). Then he says that the only person going in the Varican is the one who has an appointment, who is Rocher, expecting to bring back helpful information. They both fight the assassin, and Vittoria gives a final thrust with a torch, sending him off the balcony and crashing into a pile of cannonballs below. They rush through the square to see Max zooming to the Vatican. He waits outside of the office with Rocher, and he goes in (meanwhile, we learn that his parents wouldn't let him have medicine and to have faith... the only reason why he didn't fully heal is apparently because he had medicine). Plus, BBC said that CERN is the new Illuminati lair.
A guard goes and unlocks the door to the secret passageway connecting to the Vatican, letting Vittoria and Robert inside. The carlemengo screams inside his office, door opens, he points at Rocher, ""ILLUMINATUS,"" Kohler dies/gives Robert something to give to the media, and Carlemengo has the final brand on his chest. They take him outside, and he leaps up, exposing the brand we now see that spells the elements. He seems to think he's talking to God and runs back in, ""Upon this rock I will build my church,"" goes to the Necropolis (underground special burial site) to St. Peter's tomb where they realize the antimatter is. Carlemengo and Langdon jump in the helicopter intended to take him to the hospital with antimatter.

Right from the first page the story takes off, taking the reader on a ride like no other. The majority of the book takes place over one day, taking unimaginable and highly suspenseful twists and turns. A religious symbolist, Robert Langdon, finds himself pulled into what appears to be one of the oldest conflicts in history involving the Illuminati and the Catholic Church. It is science versus religion. Or can the two exist together? Langdon teams up with a physicist, Vittoria Vetra, and the two set out to solve a life and death puzzle that will ultimately result in the death of the Vatican City if they fail. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author, Dan Brown, did his research for this book and on every page it shows. The controversy between science and religion and whether or not the two can exist harmoniously is a very real struggle in today’s society, and Mr. Brown touched upon vital points on both sides of the fence. Although I hope not to spoil the endings of books in my brief reviews (and I will try not to do so here), I must say that this book totally surprised me with the turn it took in the end, something that is not so easy to do anymore.

To be honest, this is the first book I ever can read within days after a year! This is what I called as ""reading slump"" recovery books. I've known this book for a long time, especially when the movie adaptation was released. I'm not really remember about the movie content, so when I read this, I feel like no spoiler at all.

This book revolved around Robert Langdon, a historic professor specialized in symbolic from Harvard. He had to solve murder mystery related to Illuminati, a group of scientists who took revenge on church hundred years ago.

This novel made me want to learn more about Vatican history. Now I know why there was cut version and uncut version for the movie, because this content itself quite controversial.

Aside from religion things, I really like the history symbol, the narrative of Rome's condition, also the CERN high tech lab. I think Dan Brown really did a good job on his research for this novel.

What I like about this book
1. Fast pace!! I like how all those drama happened only in one day. And also the plot twist!!! I thought the evil one was Kohler omg
2. No filler or unnesary detail for each character
3. Using a simple language eventho the topic is hard and sensitive

What I don't like about this book

About halfway through the book, when I found myself in front of the computer confirming that Brown had gotten yet ANOTHER ""fact"" incorrect, I decided I needed to change my outlook or I'd never get through it. My recommendation for anyone reading ANY of his books is to pretend you're reading an alternate history. Same planet, same countries, same basic structure, but different. A parallel universe, if you will, where Brown's theories, translations and descriptions are simply true. Once I decided on that, I found I was able to actually enjoy the book.

I know a lot of people have issues with Brown's writing style, but I find him a perfectly competent storyteller, and one with a definite flair for the dramatic. While some parts of his mysteries are fairly easily solved, he builds enough suspense that even when you think you know what's coming, it doesn't lessen your reaction. As long as you can keep suspending your disbelief, then he's really not a bad writer. And I would definitely recommend this book over Da Vinci. For one thing, it actually comes first chronologically, so you can meet Robert Langdon properly. And secondly, it's just better written. The co-worker from whom I borrowed the book said it best when he felt that certain *something* all authors have in their debut novels that they don't have for their later ones.

Robert Langdon's character is one that is easy to become fond of. Langon walks the fine line between intelligent and impossibly knowing everything.

Why didn't I give this book a chance earlier. It's amazing. The story revolves around a lecturer/symbologist(?) from Harvard University, Robert Langdon, and he has been summoned by the authorities from Vatican City to solve a murder case which involves an ancient cult/brotherhood, the Illuminati.

I enjoy riddles generally and this book has quite a number of them. That's one aspect I really love about the book, it makes me THINK. And also, because I LEARNED NEW THINGS from reading this book. From time to time, I ended up Googling names of statues and places in Rome stated in the book. Although at times I wasn't sure which ones were real and which ones weren't, like whether if it is true that there's more to see beneath/underneath Vatican City, with all the secret hideouts and tombs and vaults and hi-tech library, and what not. But hey, it's an interesting read.

Of course, there are many religious references, especially Christianity, in the book. The main story of the book basically roots from the issue of Religion vs. Science.

I normally don't write reviews, only when a book was extraordinarily great or absolutely gruesome. From my rating I'm sure you can tell which was the case for this one. This book is the impersonation of exactly that bigotry, that sometimes make me lose faith in this world.
First of all I want to begin with the Assassin. Yes, assassin and not hassassin. I was quite confused when I read that an Islamic order was named after its drug excesses. Islam forbids any kind of drug use or smoking. Haram. So I decided to google it and LITERALLY the first paragraph, second sentence on Wikipedia over Assassins: ""Based on texts from Alamut, their grand master Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples Asāsiyyūn (أساسيون, meaning ""people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]""), but some foreign travellers like Marco Polo misunderstood the name as deriving from the term hashish."" How hard could it have been to do a tiny bit of research before writing or publishing something like that? Also could this character be anymore stereotypical? The evil Arab, who is sadistic and misogynistic. Just what we needed, because that is totally not the single story that literally every white author (including those in the media) tells about Arabs. The more you hear it, the more you believe it. Stop spreading hate and directing it to those that have already suffered the most (because Western countries like to take their homes as a playground to fight their wars).
But even though this is in my opinion the worst stereotype that is bestowed, it is far from being the only one! Let's continue with ""The Scorning Scientist, Who Despises Religion"". I can guarantee you that from all scientist, those that work at CERN, or generally in physics, are the most religious ones. Because they know better than anybody else what exactly science will never be able to explain about the world. Except for maybe philosophers they are the ones that think the most about the question ""Why is there something and not nothing?"" All they do is trying to understand God's work as good as possible. And I am surely not saying that there are no atheistic or agnostic physicists, all I am saying is that the people at CERN are definitely not going to celebrate the death/murder of the pope.
Next thing: the sexism and misogyny. Vittoria Vetra is the next embodied stereotype that made me want to throw up, while reading this book. The strong, independent, intelligent, and empowered woman that needs a man (to save her). That Dan Brown is trying to sell her as a progressive woman, that is not just smarter than the male protagonist, but can also fight better makes it even worse that he then writes things like ""in that moment she just wanted to be hold in his strong arms"". Pretty much any interaction between Langdon and Vittoria was terrible, and that is tbh most of the book. And please don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no problem with love stories, but I do have a problem with sexism. Women don't need men and men are not the antidote to all our problems. Company makes things for sure better, but we ain't no flowers thirsty for water.

Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.

TW: Rape threats

The reason I first read Dan Brown was because I trusted some of my friends who said his books are great. The reason I kept turning the pages, biting my nails, feeling like my every move was watched, feeling like time was ticking towards distraction was the indescribable action, the constant mystery, the fights, the riddles, the worry one feels when reading these books. The reason I loved it was the research, the plot, the characters, the execution of everything in this spectacular, heart-stopping book.

This is why I present to you a few reasons to pick up a Dan Brown book:
♦ Tons of research on science, religion, art, geography, philosophy and so many other branches. The amount of information in this book is maddening, and yet it is never tiring and it never feels like it drags on. The exact opposite, each small fact or huge revalation stays with the reader throughout the story, like the riddles towards an even greater mystey.
♦ A skull-cracking mystery, serial killings, the fate of the Catholic church crumbling, the world watching in shock. This book has so much page-turning action that even thinking about it now, it still steals my breath away. I kept guessing and guessing and it got me nowhere, until when I found out the truth, everything suddenly made sense.
♦ Complex, well-thought characters, and an absolutely charming dymanic between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Their relationship, the way they completed each other and the way their thoughts crossed and their knowledge tangled was an absolute delight to read about.
♦ A villain that had me press a hand on my mouth and widen my eyes in shock, as the motives, the feelings and the entire psychological complexity were absolutely unbelievable.
♦ A trip in Rome that made me feel like I knew the place, even if I've never been there. Everything was described and thought of in such detail that it all seemed familiar in some way, making me even more eager to follow the story.
♦ The entire atmosphere of lung squeezing stress the book gave me, that made me fly through and still think about it long after I had finished. Bonus because the multiple POVs worked in a very good way.

Overall, it was a truly enjoyable experience and I am very excited to pick up more of his books in the future. For now, keep reading and enjoying your autumn ♥ Get excited for October and Halloween ♥ And the most important, keep being your wonderful and unique selves ♥

This book was lousy. While I acknowledge it had a good twist and is packed full of details, anything redeemable is quickly lost in bad writing, atrocious characters, and random plot elements. Thrillers should not try and be religious discourses. They also shouldn't give the reader WAY MORE INFORMATION than ANYONE COULD EVER WANT.



I don't really read this genre, and I remember why now. My emotions throughout the book were....varied



and mostly negative.

The main character is an American-Cambridge professor-genius who we are frequently reminded is hawt, attractive to women, and emotionally traumatized. He also has weird dreams that probably reveal a fear of growing old or something.
He meets a hawt, attractive, intelligent woman who basically runs around with little clothing on, admires his brilliance, and occasionally helps explain things for the reader. #great. So much for strong female characters.
There is an Evil Baddy Bad Guy who is sexually twisted and so entirely villainous that it is morally proper to cheer for his downfall.
And a couple other characters who POV shift randomly and who are confusing and stupid and traumatized.
In retrospect, I can't blame them. I'm traumatized reading such a lousy book. Just imagine being part of it!
The plot never ends. This book goes on and on and on. I can't believe this is a series. Also, this book is starting to get dated and that is just awkward. World Wide Web. *snort*

Plenty of people think that The Da Vinci Code is first, because the film came out before Angels and Demons. But if you want to read the books in order, start with Angels and Demons. Although I can’t think the stories tie in too much together to be honest.

I love a thriller with ties to moments in history, so of course I was going to love this book. Set mainly in Rome, Robert Langdon must help uncover mysteries about the Illuminate, a long dispersed secret brotherhood. This book gave me goosebumps every few pages whenever Langdon figured something out. I felt like I was learning a lot as I was reading it too. I now know a lot more about artists in Rome than I did before.

There is a time limit on solving the mystery in this book, by midnight Langdon must solve clues to find the Illuminate or a tank of antimatter will obliterate the Vatican. It’s dramatic, it’s intense, there are lots of twists and turns and you never know who to trust. Dan Brown must spend a heck of a lot of time writing these books, because he puts so much into them. I will be visiting Rome next month and now I’m even more excited. This story featured so many landmarks and churches that are now definitely on my list of places to travel. I also now have a few random facts about them to share whilst I’m there… I’m hoping none of them are fictional!

This is a thriller like no other, Langdon has to use his brain to solve hidden clues before he runs out of time. Every time he solved something or made a discovery I was there with my mouth hanging open and my brain eager to read more. It’s not like I ever have a chance at solving these clues, but I love watching him do it. I’ve read that this series becomes quite repetitive, so I’m glad to have enjoyed this storyline before I had experienced this first hand. For me this was original and exciting, a real page turner for sure.

Langdon is a great character to read about, he’s funny and interesting and I want to follow him about. He makes serious situations just a little bit less serious, but still remains a professional. I look forward to reading more of him, but I can’t quite see why Tom Hanks was cast as him in the films. Book Langdon is meant to be a bit younger than Hanks and a bit sexier… sorry Tom!

Are they truly mutually exclusive, or can they possible co-exist peacefully or maybe even reinforce one another?

Angels & Demons was a page turner. The author's use of cliffhangers at the end of nearly every chapter makes it nearly impossible to put the book down. There were also twists and turns, so the plot was not all too predictable. But after a while the constant use of cliffhangers got a little too much for me, as it felt like the book relied too much on that to keep the reader hooked.

If you're really finicky about scientific, theological and in some cases geographical accuracy, then I'm afraid this book isn't for you. Angels and Demons is littered with mistakes and questionable logic. Brown paces the book to feel almost like a literary action movie with a cast of likeable characters and more twists and turns than an English B road. His treatment of female characters is a little archaic but not offensively so, more product of the early naughties. I'm usually good at guessing the twist in a novel but this one took me by surprise because it is a very twisty novel.

I absolutely love the whole Illuminati aspect of it; I love how Robert Langdon, a very ordinary man if you don't take his brilliant mind into account, just figure things out and fight for his own life and Vittoria's in many occasions. I also loved Vittoria! When I figured out that they would probably get something, I was like: ""oh don't let it be some cliché love story"" but it really wasn't! The most important thing was the crime and I liked Vittoria very much so when they finally got together I was like, ""That's the right way to do it"" :). The little clues and signs about Illuminati were things I took in like warm bread; I absolutely loved how it all made sense.

SPOILERS:

Now the reason for only giving it 4 stars and not 5 was because I felt like the four Prefiriti died without anyone doing them justice. The truth never really came out and Robert Langdon and Vittoria didn't do anything to do them justice when first they had both survived at gotten each other. Langdon was there himself when Baggia died, he shed tears for the man; shouldn't he want to do the man justice more than anyone? I can understand how the truth could have ruined faith for a lot of people, but it's like Ventresca got away with his awful actions - yes the man was disturbed and he'd had an awful past, surviving an attack where his own mother died but it's like Ventresca ended his days like a man to be honored and what he did was awful; He maybe got a man to do it but in theory he killed Vittoria's father, Olivetti and the four Prefiriti and not quickly.. He made them suffer and I really feel like they died for nothing. It's not okay! I can understand why the cardinals don't want to tell the truth - it would be devastating for them and especially because they are all honorable men but how Langdon and Vittoria didn't seem to do it, I don't understand.

This book is definitely not a 5-star book. There were a lot of plot conveniences, needless miscommunication, and flat-out laughable writing. I mean, I seriously don't think that Dan Brown can write. He has interesting ideas but I question his ability to craft a sentence. That being said, I'm rating this 5 stars because I gave The Da Vinci Code 4 stars and I definitely think this is the better book.

Even though I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, at times it was a bit boring since there were a lot of moments where Langdon was explaining random historical knowledge the reader needed to understand the puzzles/riddles. While there was a bit of that here, there was a lot more action to make up for it. Everything about this book felt like it had higher stakes. I mean, people were being brutally murdered left and right and they were trying to stop a bomb that was more destructive than a nuke. The stakes in The Da Vinci Code was that a singular secret was (maybe) going to be revealed/forgotten by history (as it already had been). The pace of the book felt slightly faster because of the increased action and stakes and Langdon had less time to preach about symbology.

I really liked the general plot and the characters (even though they weren't the most developed characters I've ever read.) I also thought the conclusion of the book was satisfyingly and made sense.

Obviously this book is far from perfect. As I mentioned before, Dan Brown really can't write. He tried to weave some complex themes throughout the book but, in my opinion, his writing is too ham-fisted to execute it. Things were also a bit too convenient at times and the characters had a few too many skills that were just perfect to get the characters out of whatever danger they were in. Also, words cannot describe how cringe-inducing the ~romance~ between Langdon and Vittoria was. Still, despite all reason, I really, really liked this. I don't know if I'd recommend this to people I know, but if you like Dan Brown-esque writers (aka, Dad-lit) then you'd love this.",Positive,Positive,stars book definitely book lot plot conveniences needless miscommunication laughable writing mean seriously think dan brown write interesting ideas question ability craft sentence said rating stars gave da vinci code stars definitely think better book even though enjoyed da vinci code times bit boring since lot moments langdon explaining random historical knowledge reader needed understand bit lot action make everything book felt like higher stakes mean people brutally murdered left right trying stop bomb destructive nuke stakes da vinci code singular secret maybe going history already pace book felt slightly faster increased action stakes langdon less time preach symbology really liked general plot characters even though developed characters ever read also thought conclusion book satisfyingly made sense obviously book far perfect mentioned dan brown really ca write tried weave complex themes throughout book opinion writing execute things also bit convenient times characters many skills perfect get characters whatever danger also words describe langdon vittoria still despite reason really really liked know recommend people know like dan writers aka love,True

It follows the search of a new CERN discovery, the antimatter. Robert Langdon is called by Maxmilian Kohler after an unusual death which is represented by an Illuminati symbol. Robert Langdon flies to the Vatican with Vittoria Vetra, the daughter of the murder victim. Together they follow a complicated course covering the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, hoping to find the culprit. After 4 papas are killed, Robert Langdon finally locates Illuminati's location successfully, also saving Vittoria, who has been kidnapped, and killing the supposed murderer. When I had reached this point of the book, I thought the action was about to come to an end because I was starting to feel sorry for all that these 2 poor characters had to go through. But no, the action seemed like it just started. Maximilian Kohler meets up with Carlo Ventresca, the replacing pope in absence of a papa, and all the evidence after the meeting points at Maximilian being the Illuminati killer. The antimatter is still nowhere to be found, so after Ventresca has a ""revelation"" and finds it, he and Robert fly in a helicopter to get the container as far from the Vatican as possible. Ventresca abandons Robert in the helicopter after jumping out with a parachute and Robert somehow survives the fall through landing in water. Everyone treats Ventresca like a Messiah, but Robert finally realizes the murderer has been under his nose the whole time, him being Ventresca. After he is confronted, the culprit sets himself on fire and Mortati becomes the new papa.
This book is PACKED with action and plot-twists. At first, I was a bit disappointed thinking that this book would turn out to be way too predictable, but Brown knows how to use the shock element as always. In my opinion, this book is far from predictable and I can't ever get enough of Dan Brown's writing style. He puts science inside fiction, he keeps the story always on a significant tangent with reality and he transfers the reader in a deep state inside the book's action. The romance between Robert and Vittoria is nicely developed along with the other thriller events, also keeping the book far from a love story at the same time.

I decided to re-read this book/series series when the latest book Origins was released. I have made my way through the series again, over the past couple of months (in amongst other books).
I think this series is quite fantastic, very well thought out, meticulously researched, cleverly put together, well written, vividly descriptive, and with an immense attention to detail. The historical tie-ins, puzzles, religious elements, codes, scientific references, art, and architectural elements- all blend together to make for a real gripping page turner. The stories have mystery, suspense, danger, drama, action, adventure, clues, puzzles, and an element of good vs. evil.
The series is based on Robert Langdon, who is a Harvard Professor of symbology and religious iconology. It is he who we follow on epic adventures, unravelling clues, solving puzzles, making discoveries, with danger ever present.
This story/series shouldn’t be over-thought, I think going in blind and immersing yourself in the story is the best way to have a pleasurable reading experience. I try not to buy into the hype, the critical comments, or the conspiracy theories- I just try to enjoy the story- which really isn’t hard to do, because it/they really are extremely well done. While there isn’t a great deal of character growth and development in the story/series, there really isn’t a need for it because the story makes up for that.
Dan Brown has a great formula for writing interesting, thought provoking, and suspenseful thrillers that contain plenty of twists and surprises. He has a knack for keeping his readers on the edge of our seat, anticipating what will happen next- which makes his stories quite entertaining and memorable.
In this story Robert Langdon is pitted against the Illuminati, who has a vendetta against the Catholic Church. It is a race against the clock, through catacombs, crypts, cathedrals, a vault, and more. A devastating weapon of destruction has Robert scrambling to get ahead of the clues. With a 400 year old trail of symbols, Robert has try to outwit and outplay some very powerful and clever opponents. This made for quite a thrilling read!

The story is an exciting mixture of historical facts and science fiction, which moves along quickly and is great for a quick read. But as usual, such a style results in less complex characters - a good thing for people who are bored easily with too long descriptions, but in a series, I prefer main characters that are more detailed. Instead, you learn more about the killer than about the hero. This works well for this kind of thriller, but does not match my personal preference.

though this book has had it's share of scalding reviews(most complaining of lack of research) i think that the book was really enjoyable nd educating(don't i sound corny?).

to start with, i really liked the pace of the book. to stretch a story of-what?- 10 or 11 hours over a 600+ novel without dragging the story is something to think about.


secondly, there were lot's of tidbits all over the story that were really nice to know. for e.g., did you know that raphael's second name was santi? or that the word assassin comes from the name of a tribe called the hassasin? my dad works in cern so there wasn't anything new about that in the book but the rest was pretty exciting.

thirdly, philosophy. i know, i know, a thriller isn't supposed to deal with people questioning and debating the existence of God, but this book does, and is none the less exciting for it.

fourthly, the vittoria. a girl(rather woman) who is a yoga master, particle physicist, marine biologist and also someone who disproved one einstein's theories-wow, that is amazing. she's one of the few female heroins i fing really captivating.",Negative,Positive,archivist symbologist robert langdon receives phone middle night asking come place never heard inclined think kind prank photograph murdered man faxed starts believe might confirmation life hard work though book share scalding reviews complaining lack research think book really enjoyable nd educating sound corny start really liked pace book stretch story hours novel without dragging story something think secondly lot tidbits story really nice know know raphael second name santi word assassin comes name tribe called hassasin dad works cern anything new book rest pretty exciting thirdly philosophy know know thriller supposed deal people questioning debating existence god book none less exciting fourthly vittoria girl rather woman yoga master particle physicist marine biologist also someone disproved one einstein amazing one female heroins fing really captivating,True
